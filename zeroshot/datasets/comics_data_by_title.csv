DO YOU NOT HAVE IT, THEN? OF COURSE I HAVE IT. BUT IT'S HIDDEN. DOES ANYONE OTHER THAN YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S HIDDEN? ABSOLUTELY NOT. IT'S MY INSURANCE. THE ONLY WAY ANYONE GETS THEIR HANDS ON THOSE FILES IS IF I GET FULL IMMUNITY. SO, YOU'LL TURN THE FILES OVER IF YOU'RE PROMISED PROTECTION? MAGGIE SAWYER WOULD HAVE TO ASK VERY NICELY BUT, YES, I THINK WE COULD MAKE A DEAL. THAT'S A SHAME. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THAT'S NOT WHAT BLOCKBUSTER WANTED TO HEAR AT ALL. @ # $ %. WHO WAS IN HERE WITH HIM? WHO?! THIS @ # $ % # & CITY! MAGGIE. IT'S THE MAYOR. SHE WANTS TO TALK. IN PRIVATE. COMMISSIONER. I HAVE BEEN WORKING TO BRING DOWN BLOCKBUSTER AND MARONI… IN SECRET. SUPPOSING I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE YOU, IF IT'S A SECRET, WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME? BECAUSE BLOCKBUSTER KNOWS I'M WORKING AGAINST HIM NOW. BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT I HAVE ON HIM. I HAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE DOWN SEVERAL OF HIS MAJOR OPERATIONS. BUT WE ONLY GET ONE CHANCE AT THIS. WE HAVE TO ACT TONIGHT. AND HOW WOULD YOU PROPOSE WE DO THAT? FOLLOW ME. PLEASE. WE JUST NEED TO CATCH THEM IN THE ACT… … WE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE. WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. EVEN IF THAT'S TRUE, I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH COPS I TRUST FOR AN OPERATION LIKE THIS. OUR CHIEF WITNESS WAS SHOT IN MY STATION. MACLEAN IS DEAD? YES. PROBABLY BECAUSE BLOCKBUSTER THINKS HE HAD WHAT WE HAVE. I CAN'T TRUST ANYONE. I'M COMPLETELY ON MY OWN HERE. NO… … YOU'RE NOT ON YOUR OWN, MAGGIE. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU IN BLÜDHAVEN, COMMISSIONER--SUPERMAN HAS SPOKEN HIGHLY OF YOU. AND AS CHARACTER REFERENCES GO, IT DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN THAT.

WE'LL SUBDUE THEM AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THERE'S EVIDENCE. WE JUST NEED YOU BEHIND US TO PICK THEM UP AND DO EVERYTHING ELSE BY THE BOOK. EVEN IF I WANTED TO DO THIS, I DON'T KNOW WHO I CAN DEPEND ON IN THE DEPARTMENT. YOU'RE ABOUT TO. THIS IS A LIST OF EVERY COP WHO'S EVER TAKEN A DIME FROM MARONI AND BLOCKBUSTER. BUT I'VE MADE THE MISTAKE OF TRUSTING YOU BEFORE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT… THIS IS. BUT THIS CITY HAS BEEN RUN BY CORRUPT, VIOLENT MEN, WHO THINK THEIR MONEY AND POWER PUTS THEM ABOVE THE LAW, ABOVE CONSEQUENCES. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CARRY OUT THE SINGLE BIGGEST STRIKE AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME THIS CITY HAS EVER SEEN. ARE YOU IN? WE'RE ALL IN. THANK YOU. SERIOUSLY.

"" "" What kind of story, Eleanor? "" "" One about John. "" Tell me how he became the Guardian. "" "" Well, your brother doesn't like to talk about it much. You know that. "" Nuh-uh. "" "" A marine is a kind of soldier. "" Before long, John and a lot of other soldiers got sent across the ocean to fight a war. "" No! Kyle! "" And while he was there… just like every war that ever was… ""… something terrible happened. "" #YAAARRRRRGGH! "" Bad enough that John did something he wasn't in the habit of doing back then. "" KYLE! Jason, it's too late! "" He prayed. "" John. John, We need you. "" He prayed for the strength to save the people who needed him. "" And in a flash of light, where your brother stood… "" … there stood an invincible knight, his eyes blazing with the light of heaven. That's how your brother became a superhero, sweetie. Earth's first and greatest. After the Battle of Oa, he founded a team of Lanterns called the Watchtower to protect Earth while he flew all over the Multiverse. Isn't that nice? #Uh-huh. Enough, all right? I'm working on it. Can I stop hearing about it, please? You're only hearing about it because you're sneaking around back there instead of working. Nobody's sneaking! Can't I take a minute to look at my girls? One day, when he'd done what he set out to do, he took off his ring, and passed it on. He became an architect, like he'd always wanted. And now we all live here together in the house he built for us, and he's finally putting up a fence to keep the rabbits out of my flowers. Just pretend I'm not here, all right? #Hmm. What about the war, Momma? What if the… … th-the… JOHN. JOHN. WE NEED YOU. Rayner? Is that you? THEY'VE FOUND HER, JOHN. MANY OF US HAVE FALLEN. THE BRIGHT REVENANT IS WITH THEM. What, Momma? Did something happen again? I-it's nothing, sweetie. Why don't you practice your reading for a bit? I need to talk to your brother. You told me you formed the Watchtower so they wouldn't need you anymore. That you were done fighting. It's nothing to worry about. The Corps just needs a hand with-- Don't talk to me like I'm stupid, John. She said, "" They found her. "" You gave me back the daughter I buried. The same age she was when I lost her, and she hasn't aged a day since then.  I know a miracle like that has to be paid back someday. Tell me the truth, John… … is that day today? They're called the Radiant Dead. They're the ones that killed the Old Guardians. If they'd killed the Central Battery like they meant to, there wouldn't be a Corps anymore… probably nothing else, either. So I took the battery from Oa, and I hid it… … in the shape of my baby sister. It really is still her, Mom. My memory of her, anyway. She's just… more than she used to be. Don't worry. I'll fix this. I'll never forget what you did for your sister. But swear to me you'll come back, too. I will. I'll come back. You'll never have to bury either of us again. I've gotta leave for a bit, kiddo. But I won't be long. Take care of your momma, yeah? Okay. And keep practicing your reading. You know We love hearing you read. I know. I'll be right back. And I'll finish that fence. Where's John going, Momma? He's going to do what he does, sweetie. The things no one else can do. "" What do you mean, 'no one else'?' Cause John was a soldier? "" "" Some people think so. His way of never quitting… his mind for strategy, the way he leads people. "" But no, that's not why. "" John's special because he's a builder. "" His mind has always pushed against the limitations that were set on him. "" Limitations of resources, or time… even the rules of three-dimensional space. "" With his mind, his will, and the power he's been given, he can do anything. ""… is that he was looking for the ring before he knew it existed. "" My boy's been the Guardian since the day he was born. "" "" But he's not limited anymore. "" What makes him special, even among the other Lanterns… The Guardian is with us! "" And whether any of us like it or not… ” ""… there are some threats only he can face. "" John! Sit-rep, Natasha. Does this situation not speak for itself? An hour ago, we had 2,300 Lanterns! We're down to barely a thousand! 932! You should've called me earlier. You're retired! It's okay. We're gonna get them all back. If the big one gets any closer to the Battery, it's gonna-- Oh god. It's happening. Everybody fall back! The BRIGHT REVENANT is awake! It's headed for Earth! It's after the Battery. I've got him. You've…? What, alone?! John, it'll kill you! You're not wrong to be afraid, kid. But you're wrong to let them see it. We're Lanterns. Let our enemies fear us. I know what you are. I know how old you are and how strong. I know you've killed the greatest heroes and gods of a thousand worlds. But this isn't their home you're threatening now. It's mine. The Guardian! All hail the Guardian! Hail John Stewart! "" Your brother was the greatest of all time. He always will be. "" But he did his time as a superhero. "" Like all the heroes in the old stories, his works of war are done. Now he's doing his works of peace. Will the monsters come back, Momma? Will they try to take me away again? No, sweetie. With your brother John around… ""… we'll never be apart again. "" IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS. THREE YEARS OF RESEARCH. THREE YEARS OF TRACKING DOWN LEGENDS AND MYTHS. ALL LEADING HERE… … THE TEMPLE OF LIFE. AND THE TWO MEN WITH ME? ABOUT AS TRUSTWORTHY AS SOMEONE WITH THE LAST NAME LUTHOR. BUT LIKE LUTHOR, THEY'D DO ANYTHING FOR CASH. NOW? WHICH IS GREAT, BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE CARRYING THE BAGS. BAGS I'M SURE THEY THINK THEY'LL FILL WITH TREASURE AFTER THEY GET RID OF ME. BOY, DID THEY GET THAT WRONG. MY NAME IS KENDRA SAUNDERS, SOMETIMES KNOWN AS HAWKGIRL. AND I'M NOT DYING TODAY. TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF MY LIFE. I'M SURE THESE GOONS'LL BE OKAY. I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE THE JUNGLE IS TEEMING WITH POISONOUS ANIMALS, BUGS, SNAKES… OH WAIT. BUT THEY MIGHT FARE BETTER WITH THOSE THAN WHAT'S IN HERE. IT'S CALLED THE TEMPLE OF LIFE, BUT IT'S REALLY ANYTHING BUT. EXACTLY WHAT I NEED. I KNOW. SOUNDS STRANGE. BUT SO IS MY LIFE… OR LIVES, AS IT WERE. I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN REINCARNATED HUNDREDS OF TIMES. AND WHAT'S EVEN WILDER, I REMEMBER EACH OF THOSE LIVES. SOUNDS FUN, RIGHT? TO KEEP COMING BACK? KNOWING IF I LANDED IN A PIT LIKE THESE GUYS BELOW ME, I'D JUST APPEAR IN A NEW BODY, READY TO TRY AGAIN. LIKE SOME SORT OF MYSTICAL VIDEO GAME WITH INFINITE LIVES. BUT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BLESSING TURNED OUT TO BE A CURSE. A BURDEN. I REALIZED THAT NO MATTER WHAT I DID, IT WAS SOMETHING I HAD DONE BEFORE. A LIFE OF PERPETUAL SAMENESS. I WAS NO LONGER UNIQUE. I WASN'T EVEN A PERSON. NOT REALLY. I WAS… A VESSEL WAITING TO BE EMPTIED AND FILLED UP AGAIN AND AGAIN… IT'S LIKE DA VINCI SAID, "" I THOUGHT I WAS LEARNING TO LIVE. I WAS ONLY LEARNING TO DIE. "" BUT TODAY THAT CHANGES. TODAY I GET MY LIFE BACK. I GET MY MORTALITY. AND NOTHING… IS GOING TO STOP ME! NOT EVEN ANCIENT DEATH TRAPS. THERE IT IS. THE VASE OF MORTALITY. LEGEND HAS IT THAT AN ANCIENT GOD-KING CREATED THE WORLD AND MADE EVERYTHING IN IT IN HIS IMAGE-IMMORTAL. NOTHING DIED, AND BECAUSE OF IT, NOTHING LIVED. THE BEAUTY OF THE WORLD THAT WAS ONCE SO VIBRANT, OVER TIME, TURNED DULL. THE GOD'S SON AND DAUGHTER TOLD THE GOD-KING HE WAS WRONG TO MAKE THE WORLD LIKE THEM, AND THE KING AGREED. HE CRIED A RIVER OF TEARS, WHICH FILLED THE EARTH. AND WHEN THE TEARS RECEDED, THE ANIMALS AND PLANTS HAD REGAINED THEIR LUSTER. THEY KNEW THAT THEIR LIVES WOULD END, AND THEREFORE, THEY HAD BETTER GET TO LIVING THEM. NO MORE PAST. NO MORE FUTURE, NO MORE "" DESTINY. "" JUST TODAY. JUST THE CHANCE TO MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS. TO CHOOSE MY OWN RELATIONSHIPS. TO SOMEDAY PASS AWAY KNOWING THAT I WAS UNIQUE TO MYSELF. A SNOWFLAKE NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. I WAS SPECIAL. YOU DO THIS, KENDRA, THAT'S IT. YOU'VE ONLY GOT ONE MORE SHOT AT LIFE. #### IT! I FEEL… FINE. MAYBE IT WAS JUST A STUPID MYTH-- #ACK!  #AHHHHH… AHHHH… AHH… #HUFF# IT'S GONE. THE MEMORIES. THE LIVES. I'M ALIVE. THE DREAM OF MY FUTURE MY OWN. NO MORE REINCARNATION. JUST THE LIFE AHEAD OF ME AND WHAT I CHOOSE TO MAKE OF IT. #ACK! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! THIS IS IT? THIS IS HOW IT ENDS? NOW?!

IT'S MORE LIKE WE'VE FOUND THE PHONE NUMBER TO THREE DIFFERENT BARRY ALLENS, BUT EACH ONE OF THEM HAS A DIFFERENT AREA CODE. WE JUST NEED TO DIAL AND FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE IS "" OUR "" BARRY. SORRY… HOLD ON. "" OUR "" BARRY? YES… THIS IS ALL THEORETICAL, BUT THE FREQUENCY WE HAVE MAY ALSO LEAD TO OTHER VERSIONS OF BARRY ACROSS THE OMNIVERSE. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'RE THROUGH WITH MULTIPLE UNIVERSES. SO WE'LL SEND YOU INTO THE SPEED FORCE TO CHECK THE CONNECTIONS, AND HOPEFULLY BRING OUR BARRY HOME. THAT'S WHY WE NEED YOU. DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE NATURE OF THE SPEED FORCE, ANYONE NOT A CONDUIT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY DISINTEGRATE UPON ENTERING THE SPEED PORTAL. LISTEN… WE NEED BARRY. WITH THE JUSTICE LEAGUE DEAD, THERE'S A VACUUM OUT THERE, AND BARRY… HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST HEROES THAT'S EVER LIVED. HE'S ALSO-- FAMILY. PART OF OUR FAMILY.

I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY. @HAPPY AND { € A $ # RICH. BUT ENOUGH TALK OF OGRES, FOR I MUST INTRODUCE YOU TO TWO PRINCES WHO WERE THAT DAY GATHERED TO EAT. I'M NERVOUS. DON'T START. WHO WERE THAT DAY WAITING FOR YET ANOTHER PRINCE TO ARRIVE. THIS IS A BIG DEAL TO ME. I'M AWARE. BUT YOU HAVING ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR PANIC ATTACKS RIGHT NOW ISN'T GOING TO HELP ANYTHING. THIS GUY'S A PROFESSIONAL. SO ARE WE. THAT'S ALL IT IS. THE LOFTY WARLORD IS LECTURING ME ABOUT PROFESSIONALISM? HIDING BEHIND A BEARD AND A SWORD ISN'T A CAREER, IT'S A GAME. WE'RE BOTH SUPERHEROES. I DON'T NEED YOU OF ALL PEOPLE JUDGING ME. WHO'S JUDGING YOU? I'M JUST SAYING, CALM DOWN AND LOOK NORMAL. LET'S JUST TRY TO BE NORMAL, OKAY? YOU AND ALL THE NORMAL. WHAT'S NORMAL? BEATS ME, FELLOWS. AND THEN, FINALLY, THE THREE GLORIOUS PRINCES OF THE REALM WERE UNITED! GUESS WHO MADE THE TRADE AND GOT THE THING?! EH, YOU'LL NEVER GUESS, IT WAS ME! METAMORPHO! WONDERFUL. THE WAITRESS IS COMING OVER. YOU COULDN'T PUT ON A COAT, COME IN THE DOOR? YOU HAVE IT HERE? CAN I SEE IT? I'M GAS. I CAN'T CARRY THINGS. IT'S IN THE CAR. YOU LEFT IT IN THE CAR?! WHERE'S YOUR CAR? OUTSIDE. I GOT A SPOT ON THE STREET. YOU GUYS ORDER? ANYTHING LOOK GOOD? DOES IT HURT? C'MON, WE'RE GOING. WHAT'S WITH YOU? HE JUST GOT HERE! LOOK WHAT HE'S BEEN THROUGH! LET HIM EAT. I COULD EAT LATER. IT'S NO TROUBLE. IT'S IN HIS CAR. WE'RE LEAVING. HURRY UP. ALL RIGHT, I'M COMING! GOD, EVERYTHING'S AN ORDER TO YOU. YOU'RE NOT IN THE MILITARY ANYMORE, TRAVIS. I'M NOT YOUR PRIVATE. YES, SIR! NO, SIR! DON'T GET RUFFLED. I PARKED RIGHT OUTSIDE, NOT IN THE LOT. I'M SURE IT'S FINE. AS OUR THREE PRINCES SET OFF UPON THEIR QUEST, WE TURN OUR ATTENTION NOW TO A GREAT AND POWERFUL WIZARD… WE HAVE SPENT A HUNDRED GENERATIONS PREPARING FOR THIS EVIL TO ARISE. NOW THEY HAVE FINALLY REVEALED THEMSELVES. THEY ARE HERE. THE TRUE HUNT BEGINS. AND HIS SACRED AND MOST TRUSTWORTHY SERVANT… THE GOOD KNIGHT OF THE REALM. THEY MAY RUN. THEY WILL DIE. THERE IS, HOWEVER AND MOST UNFORTUNATELY, A COMPLICATION THAT I FEAR MAY TEST YOU, MANHUNTER. SOMETHING THAT MAY INSPIRE YOUR MERCY. THERE IS NO MERCY IN THE HUNT. IF THAT IS YOUR TEST, IT IS PASSED. MY BOY, POOR BOY, I HAVE WATCHED YOU SINCE YOU WERE A BABE. I HAVE SEEN YOU FORGED, AND I AM SORRY FOR WHAT YOU MUST DO… MARK, MY SON… … THEY'RE CHILDREN. BACK, THEN, TO OUR LADS, WHO WERE ENJOYING THEMSELVES MIGHTILY AS THEY SPED THROUGH THE HEAT OF THE NEARBY DESERT. THEIR GRANDIOSE AND GRACIOUS YELP SINGING THROUGH THE AIR. DINGBATS OF DANGER STREET ON THE MOTHER Ø < % @ ¥ RISE, MOTHER $# % # $ #! # @ $ # # #! NOT FAR OFF, THE THREE GOOD PRINCES RODE THEIR OWN STEED AT A STEADIER PACE. WE'RE FAR ENOUGH, AND THERE'S NO ONE HERE. CAN I LOOK AT IT? THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF TIME WHEN WE STOP. I DON'T NEED YOU DROPPING IT IN THE ROAD. YOU'RE TOO HARD ON THE KID. LET HIM SEE. WHAT'S THE HARM? KID? STARMAN? HE'S OLDER THAN THE TWO OF US COMBINED. THEY JUST HAVE DIFFERENT YEARS ON HIS PLANET. NO ONE'S OLDER THAN YOU ON ANY PLANET. LET ME SEE IT. YOU'RE MEAN WHEN YOU WANT THINGS. IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY. HERE. ENJOY. HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS? IT'LL BE WORTH IT, YOU'LL SEE. WHEN WE GET THIS DONE… WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT, BIG PEOPLE, I'M SAYING… ...THERE'S NOTHING LIKE BEING IN THE LEAGUE. IT'S FIRST CLASS ALL THE WAY. IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SERVICE. OH, LISTEN TO YOU. HOW MANY FACES YOU WEAR. JESUS, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. YOU ALMOST FEEL SORRY FOR DARKSEID. MEANWHILE, IN A CITY FAR TO THE EAST, OUR OGRE WAS MAKING A GALLANT ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER HIS NEXT AND BEST DESTINY. I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT CRIME LIKE YOU USUALLY HEAR IT, AS SOMETHING THAT WILL SCARE YOU. AS A MOMENT OF VIOLENCE THAT WILL RIP YOUR LOVED ONES FROM YOU. FOR JUST AS WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND OGRES, OGRES OFTEN DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES. NOT THAT CRIME ISN'T THAT. IT IS. I'VE SEEN IT UP CLOSE. I'VE LOST TOO MUCH TO ITS EVIL TO DISMISS THAT. BUT WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES. MANY OF US DON'T EXPERIENCE CRIME LIKE WE SEE ON THE TV. MANY OF US, MOST OF US, DON'T LIVE IN THE BIG CITIES WHERE CRIME IS TOLERATED, EVEN ENCOURAGED BY THESE SOCIALIST MAYORS AND GOVERNORS. BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIVE GOOD, DECENT, CHRISTIAN LIVES, CRIME CAN SEEM LIKE EVERYONE ELSE'S PROBLEM --A SYMPTOM OF A DISEASE YOU DON'T HAVE. AND IN THAT WAY, YOU CAN COME TO DISMISS ITS IMPACT ON OUR SOCIETY AS BEING ABOUT CREEPS GETTING PUNISHED BY OTHER CREEPS. THAT'S WHY TODAY, I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE REALITY OF THE CRIME TAX IN AMERICA. AND HOW THE REAL VICTIM OF CRIME IS NOT JUST THE PERSON UNDER THE GUN, BUT SOMEONE MILES AWAY, SOMEONE JUST LIKE… ..YOU. YOU SEE, WE PAY FOR CRIME. WE PAY IN TERMS OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE SCENE, THE POLICE TAKING STATEMENTS, "" SOLVING "" THE CRIMES. EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, SOMEONE IN YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS TO WORK TO HELP BRING JUSTICE, AND THAT WORK IS PAID FOR BY YOUR DOLLARS. AND WE DON'T JUST PAY THE CRIME TAX FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CRIME, WE PAY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRIME, THE ANTICIPATION OF CRIME. FOR ALL THE SAFETY MEASURES PUT IN PLACE TO PREVENT THESE DEGENERATES FROM ILLEGALLY TAKING WHAT THEY NEVER EARNED. ALL OF THAT IS PAID FOR BY YOU. BY SALES TAX AND FEDERAL TAX AND WHATEVER OTHER KIND OF TAX THEY'RE SCRAPING OUT OF YOU. A MAYOR LETS HIS CITY ROT AND YOU MISS A PAYMENT ON YOUR TRUCK, AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHY. YOU DON'T SEE THAT IT'S ALL CONNECTED. THE VICTIMS OF CRIME EXTEND FAR OUT FROM THE MOMENTS OF CRIME. THAT'S THE TRUTH, AND TO DENY THAT WOULD BE PUTTING YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND. AND WE'RE NOT-- OKAY, THAT'S GREAT, JACK. WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK THERE? I LOVE IT. ARE YOU SURE? I CAN DO TEN MORE MINUTES EASY. I'VE ALSO GOT A SEGMENT THAT LEANS MORE INTO HUMOR, SORT OF A "" TOP TEN "" COUNTDOWN THING. NO, NO, WE'RE FINE. YOU DID GREAT. THE EXPECTATION WAS EXCEEDED, HONESTLY. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL. OKAY, OKAY, GREAT. JUST LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE. NOPE, I THINK THAT'S IT. IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO MAKEUP, THEY'LL CLEAN YOU UP. GET YOUR MIC OFF FIRST. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. DO YOU NEED ME AFTER THAT ANYWHERE?

DURING THE INVESTIGATION, I STARTED UP WITH ICE, GUY'S EX-GIRLFRIEND. GUY DIDN'T TAKE KINDLY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT, AND WHEN HE VIOLENTLY LASHED OUT, ICE AND I KILLED HIM.  AND BECAUSE KILLING'S NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR JL MEMBERS, WE HID THE BODY AND WENT ON WITH OUR LIVES. WHEN I FOUND OUT HE'D DONE IT, ALL THE BETTER THAT HE WAS ALREADY GONE. AND NOW I'M FALLING FROM 20,000 FEET. GUY IS MY FRIEND. HE TELLS ME HE HAS PROBLEM WITH YOU. HE IS ANGRY WITH YOU. HE WANTS TO FIGHT YOU. I AM KNOWING GUY WELL. HE WANTS FIGHT, HE WILL HAVE FIGHT. WE WERE GOING TO HAVE DINNER DAYS AGO. HE DOES NOT SHOW. I CALL, HE DOES NOT ANSWER. THIS IS NOT SO INTERESTING WITH GUY. HE IS NOT SO POLITE. BUT WHEN I LOOK FOR HIM, I CAN'T FIND. AND I REMEMBER HE IS HAVING FIGHT WITH YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR LITTLE BOWL CUT BOY IS. I'M NOT HIS BABYSITTER. I THINK HAL HAS THAT MISERABLE DUTY. WHY DON'T YOU TRY DROPPING HIM? SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YOU ARE SAYING YOU DO NOT KNOW?  AT THIS TIME, WITH YOUR LIFE IN MY HAND, THAT IS ALL YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY. WELL… NO, THAT'S NOT ALL. I GUESS… IF YOU PRESSED ME… I WOULD ADD: % ## % YOU. JUST TO BE COMPLETE ABOUT THE THING. #HM. I SAVE YOU LAST TIME BECAUSE I THINK MAYBE YOU ARE NOT BROKEN IN HEAD. MAYBE YOU WANT TO TALK.

NONE. I CHECK TO SEE IF GUY'S LANTERN IS HERE ON EARTH. ENERGY CAN BE TRACKED. AND AGAIN, THERE IS NONE. NONE. HE IS NOT ON EARTH. IS NOT OFF EARTH. IS STRANGE. SO WHILE YOU ARE SLEEPING, I EXAMINE YOU WITH ARMOR. I SEE YOU HAVE THIS RING ENERGY ON YOU. JUST TRACES. USUALLY YOU WON'T FIND THIS ON PEOPLE UNLESS IT IS PRESSED HARD INTO THE SKIN WHERE IT CAN BE DETECTED FOR ALMOST WEEK. I SEE THIS ON YOUR NECK. I THINK. MAYBE HE WAS STRANGLING YOU. SO A MAN WHO HATES YOU DISAPPEARS AND YOU HAVE ENERGY ON YOU THAT SAY HE WAS TRYING TO HURT YOU. AND DO YOU SAY, "" OH, THERE WAS A FIGHT AND HE WAS HURT, "" OR "" OH, THERE WAS A FIGHT AND HE RAN AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE. "" NO, YOU SAY YOU KNOW NOTHING. THIS, I THINK, MEANS YOU KILLED HIM. MY MOUTH FILLS WITH BLOOD. WE WERE FAMILY. THE JUSTICE LEAGUE INTERNATIONAL. WE WERE NOT SUPERMAN AND BATMAN AND FLASH, ORIGINAL GOOD GUYS. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE US. WE ONLY HAD EACH OTHER. WE SAW EACH OTHER MAKE MISTAKE THAT SUPERMAN WOULD NOT ALLOW. AND BECAUSE OF THIS, BECAUSE WE COULD FORGIVE, WE WERE FAMILY. IT RUNS COPPER DOWN MY THROAT. WHERE IS GUY GARDNER? MY BROTHER. LET ME AT LEAST BURY HIM. I SWALLOW IT DOWN. I SPIT SOMETHING OUT. WHAT KIND OF NAME IS ROCKET RED? YOU SOUND LIKE A # @ % & @ $ # CANDY BAR. AND MY MOUTH FILLS WITH BLOOD AGAIN.  I TOOK OFF ALL OF ARMOR BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE TOO TEMPTING TO KILL YOU BEFORE I GOT RIGHT INFORMATION. I THINK MAYBE I SHOULD PUT IT BACK ON. THERE'S THAT INK. SAME AS BEFORE.

WE GOT AN ALERT ON THE JUSTICE LEAGUE COMMS- IT IS FROM GUY. HE IS SAYING HE IS MOVED TO ANOTHER DIMENSION UNEXPECTEDLY. HE IS ON MISSION NOW AND WILL BE RETURNING SHORTLY. COMMUNICATION IN THE DIMENSION IS LIMITED, BUT I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO HIM BRIEFLY. I SEEM TO HAVE MADE MISTAKE. I BROUGHT YOU BOTTLE. VERY BEST. NOW, PERHAPS WE HAVE OCCASION TO CELEBRATE. WHAT'S THAT? YOU HAVE SEEN ME AT MY WORST. YOU WILL FORGIVE. YOU ARE NOW PART OF FAMILY. AFTER MY DAD DIED, I DECIDED THAT WAS IT. IT WAS MY JOB TO TAKE THE BULLET. IT WAS MY JOB TO DIE. AND I WOULDN'T BE LIKE MY DAD. WHEN I WENT, I WOULDN'T LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND. I WOULDN'T BE SELFISH LIKE HIM. I DIDN'T NEED A FAMILY TO FAIL. CHRISTOPHER! A WHOLE DAY.

THIS MOMENT OF COMPASSION WILL BE REPAID TENFOLD IN VIOLENCE AND MISERY. THIS IS YOUR FAULT. IF I HAD DESTROYED EGGMAN IN WINDMILL VILLAGE. NONE OF THIS WOULD BE HAPPENING. JUST LIKE I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET YOU CONVINCE ME TO LEAVE EGGMAN IN WINDMILL VILLAGE. OH. HEY, METAL. LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE FULLY REPAIRED, HUH? AHHH… THAT LIFE WAS RELAXING.

MEANWHILE, ON THAT SAME DAY, AT THAT SAME HOUR, JUST A FEW FLOORS BELOW, THE LADY OF WESTSHIRE WELCOMED HER FIRSTBORN, FARE THE HEIR TO THE LAND AND HEARTH. THERE, YOU SEE, A BOY, AS PROMISED. OUR ROGER. THE NEXT ROGER. WHAT A LEGACY YOU INHERIT, CHILD, WHAT A LIFE YOU SHALL LEAD. THE LADY OF THE HOUSE WAS KINDLY, AND SHE ALLOWED MY MOTHER TO CARE FOR ME AS SHE HELPED TO RAISE THE YOUNG LORD ROGER. AND IN THAT CONTEXT, WE TOOK OUR FIRST STEPS TOGETHER. SAID OUR FIRST WORDS TO ONE ANOTHER. WE TAUGHT EACH OTHER HOW TO PLAY. WE TAUGHT EACH OTHER HOW TO LAUGH. AND YES, DESPITE MY MOTHER'S MANY, MANY PROTESTS, WE TAUGHT EACH OTHER TIME AND AGAIN HOW TO FIGHT. AND… HOW TO LOVE! AS FOR OUR FIRST KISS… ROGER! TODAY I AM FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND TODAY YOU ARE ALSO FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND SO WE HAVE TO KISS! ROGER! TODAY I AM FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND TODAY YOU ARE ALSO FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND SO WE HAVE TO KISS!  ALL RIGHT. WELL… IT WAS SHARED. #HA HA HA HA HA AND IT WAS LOVELY. HOWEVER, AS THE YEARS PASSED, WE LEARNED QUICKLY ENOUGH THAT THOUGH WE WERE BORN IN THE SAME ILLUSTRIOUS MANOR… WE STILL LIVED IN TWO SEPARATE WORLDS. JOAN! HELLO, ROGER. DO YOU LIKE MY NEW OUTFIT? THE BOOTS WERE A GIFT FROM THE KING FOR MY BIRTHDAY. THEY CAME WITH A VERY KIND NOTE WISHING ME WELL. AND TODAY FATHER IS TAKING ME ON MY FIRST HUNT, ISN'T THAT JUST THRILLING, JOAN? OH, IT'S SO WONDERFUL, ROGER! I BET YOU CATCH FORTY PHEASANTS! AT LEAST! I WISH YOU COULD COME, I DO. I AM SO USED TO HAVING YOU BY MY SIDE. NOTHING FEELS QUITE RIGHT WITHOUT YOU. DON'T BE SILLY. ANGELICA IS ILL AND I HAVE TO PREPARE THE CURTAINS IN THE GRAND HALL ON MY OWN. IT WILL TAKE HOURS. NOT THAT… BUT I WOULD LOVE TO ONE DAY, I WOULD LOVE TO LEARN TO SHOOT AS YOU DO. I WOULD LOVE TO… I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TEACH ME. YOU'LL DO THAT, WON'T YOU, ROGER? PLEASE, PLEASE PROMISE ME. AND SO THE DAYS SLIPPED BY, AND WE EACH MET THE OBLIGATIONS ASSIGNED TO US AT BIRTH. ROGER WENT UPON HIS WAY. C'MON, CHESTER, GIVE IT A GO, OLD BOY. GLORY AWAITS. AND I WENT UPON MINE. AREN'T YOU A FILTHY THING? HOW HAVE THEY BEEN TREATING YOU TO GET YOU THIS WAY? YEARS PASSED, AND I WAS GIVEN A PERMANENT POSITION IN THE HOUSE. MY MOTHER TOLD EVERYONE I WAS BLESSED, FATED EVEN, TO BECOME THE HOUSE KEEPER OF HILL HOUSE. IF YOU COULD IMAGINE. ROGER SEEMED TO GROW MORE CONFIDENT (AND MORE DASHING!) EACH DAY. HIS UNTARNISHED REPUTATION AS A MAN OF AMBITION AND FORTITUDE SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE, AND MANY A GOSSIP WONDERED WHO WOULD BE THE LUCKY LASS TO FINALLY CATCH HIS EYE. SOON THE LADY WAS ARRANGING FOR DOZENS OF GIRLS FROM THE BEST FAMILIES, FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, TO COME TO HILL HOUSE AND MEET MY ROGER. I MEAN, AND MEET HER ROGER. OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. HOW STUPID OF ME. BUT THEN AGAIN… JOAN… ROGER? JOAN, I… I WAS WONDERING… WELL, I'M SORRY TO… BUT… BUT YOU SEE… I REMEMBER I… I DID PROMISE YOU… A WHILE BACK… TOO LONG, REALLY… BUT I SAID… IF YOU… I'VE BEEN THINKING ON IT… WELL, I HAD SOME TIME AND… AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS WE MIGHT… IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT, ROGER? YOU LOOK FLUSHED. JOAN, WOULD YOU… COULD YOU… I… I WOULD BE HAPPY IF I MIGHT SHOW YOU HOW TO SHOOT, TAKE YOU NOW, IN FACT. YOU DID SAY YOU WANTED TO LEARN, JOAN. DIDN'T YOU? OH, YES, VERY MUCH. JOLLY! THAT'S… THAT'S JUST JOLLY! ROGER TOOK ME TO A SMALL COTTAGE HALF A MILE FROM THE HOUSE, NEAR THE EDGE OF THE WEST FOREST. THEY KEPT THE SHOTGUNS HERE, HE EXPLAINED POLITELY, AND WE COULD TAKE THEM AND GO TO THE WOODS AND PRACTICE. I WOULD LIKE THAT, ROGER. TO PRACTICE, I MEAN. YES, THAT WOULD BE… HE WAS SUDDENLY SO CLOSE TO ME. I FELT HIS HEART BEAT AS I'M SURE HE FELT MINE. OH JOAN. AND THEN… OH, AND THEN… THEY WERE BEATING AS ONE! WELL? HOW… IF YOU START IN WITH THE LAUGHING, JOAN DARLING, I'M JUST GOING TO ABOUT DIE! NO. NO, NO, NO, MY SWEET, MY OWN, MY ROGER. THAT WAS DIVINE. BUT WEREN'T WE HERE FOR THE SHOOTING? HIS LIPS UPON MINE, I SHOULD'VE FELT SAFE, SECURE, AS IF ALL THE PROBLEMS OF YESTERDAY WERE MERE SOAP BUBBLES, SO EASILY POPPED AS WE REACHED OUR HAPPILY EVER AFTER. BUT INSTEAD I KNEW WE WERE JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF… ROGER! MY SON! MY BOY! HOW COULD YOU SHAME OUR FAMILY LIKE THIS?! HOW COULD YOU BETRAY WHO YOU ARE?! AFTER OUR FIRST --NO, SECOND! --MAGNIFICENT KISS, ROGER AND I WENT BACK TO OUR OWN WORLDS. I CONTINUED TO PREPARE THE HOUSE FOR THE EVENING… AND HE CONTINUED TO PREPARE HIMSELF FOR THE GLORIOUS DESTINY THAT HAD AWAITED HIM SINCE BEFORE HIS BIRTH. WHENEVER WE'D SEE EACH OTHER, IT WAS ALL HANDLED VERY FORMALLY. IF ANYTHING, IT WAS PERHAPS A BIT MORE STIFF AND REHEARSED THAN BEFORE. MISS PETERSON. MY LORD. BUT EVERY FEW DAYS, HE'D COME TO ME AND OFFER ME A "" HUNTING LESSON, ” AND WE'D DASH OFF TO THE SMALL COTTAGE WITH ALL THE GUNS. HURRY, DARLING, THE HOURS ARE NOT AS LONG AS THEY SEEM! OH, ROGER, REALLY! AND THERE WE'D FIND OUR SANCTUARY AND WE'D AGAIN SHARE OUR KISSES. YOU KNOW, JOAN, DARLING, WE DON'T HAVE TO GO AHEAD WITH THE FARCE OF THE HIKE AND THE HOUNDS. WE MIGHT SPEND THIS TIME MORE… INTIMATELY. I WISH IT WERE SO SIMPLE, ROGER. BUT IF WE NEVER LEAVE THE INSIDE OF THAT HOUSE, THEN THIS FLIMSY EXCUSE WILL TAKE TO THE WIND FASTER THAN THOSE BIRDS.  NO, EVERYONE THINKS YOU ARE THE KIND GENTLEMAN TEACHING AN OLD, POOR FRIEND A NEW TRICK. AND I'M AFRAID WE MUST DO OUR BEST TO ACT THAT OUT. OR RISK LOSING IT ALTOGETHER! WAS IT NOT A FINE SHOT, ROGER?! I AM GETTING QUITE GOOD, AREN'T I? YES, MY DARLING. QUITE! WEEKS PASSED, THE HAPPIEST WEEKS OF MY LIFE. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER IN WHAT DRUDGERY I WAS ENGAGED, FOR MY THOUGHTS WERE ALWAYS ON THE HUNT. ON ROGER AND THE HUNT, I MEAN. FOR THE HUNT WAS AN EXCUSE FOR US TO BE TOGETHER WHEN THE STORMS OF CLASS AND WEALTH WERE ALWAYS TRYING TO REND US APART. I MEAN. I NEVER WANTED THOSE DAYS TO END. BUT, SADLY, IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING, YOU KNOW NOTHING IS EVERLASTING. JOAN! I SAW YOU WALKING, I WAS BEHIND YOU, LOOKING AT YOU, AND JOAN, I CANNOT DO IT ANYMORE! I CANNOT LIVE THIS WAY IN MY OWN HOUSE! HIDING LIKE THE PHEASANTS IN THE FIELD! WAITING FOR THE DOGS TO COME!  JOAN DARLING, THE HUNT MUST END! YOU MUST MARRY ME! ROGER! I WAS IN HIS ARMS WHERE I HAD ALWAYS LONGED TO BE, AND IT WAS AGAIN LOVELY, AND YET I COULD FEEL NOTHING BUT FEAR. WE CAN'T, MY LOVE… WE CAN'T… DON'T, JOAN. I KNOW ALL THE POWERS GATHERED AGAINST US. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW MY POWER, THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY STRENGTH. OH, HOW HIS WORDS LIFTED ME, I BEGAN TO FEEL A DASH OF HOPE. MY STRENGTH WHEN I AM WITH YOU. BUT THEN! AT THE DOOR! LORD WESTSHIRE! MY WORD! WHAT IS THIS, ROGER?! GET YOUR HANDS OFF THAT COMMON WOMAN! FATHER! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND-- I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY WELL! I WILL NOT HAVE SOME DALLIANCE BECOME A SCANDAL! THIS BEHAVIOR WILL NOT BE TOLERATED IN THIS HOUSE! YOU HAVE DUTIES TO THE NAME I GIFTED YOU, AND I WILL SEE THEM FULFILLED! FATHER, JOAN IS NOT A DALLIANCE! I LOVE HER! YOU YOUNG FOOL! YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT LOVE IS! ROGER LEFT AFTER THAT. OR RATHER, HIS PARENTS SENT HIM AWAY TO LIVE WITH SOME COUSIN OR OTHER. I EXPECTED TO BE LET GO, BUT THE FAMILY WAS DESPERATE TO HIDE ANY HINT OF IMPROPRIETY AND TO SQUASH EVERY RUMOR. THE DISMISSAL OF THE MAID AT THE SAME TIME AS ROGER'S DEPARTURE COULD BE THE CAUSE OF A GREAT DEAL OF TALK. AND A GREAT DEAL OF TALK WAS ALWAYS TO BE AVOIDED. SO I RESUMED MY CHORES, CLEANING HILL HOUSE FOR ALL THE GOOD MEN AND WOMEN WHO LIVED THERE. ALL OF THOSE RICH, WELLBORN PEOPLE WHO EXPECTED A WELL-KEPT HOUSE. FOR THEM, I SCRUBBED AND I WASHED AND I FOLDED AND I DUSTED AND I… AND I… AND I HEARD ROGER'S WORDS, AGAIN AND AGAIN. ""DARLING,” HE SAID, ""THE HUNT MUST END!"" MONTHS PASSED AND THEN THE DAY CAME, THE DAY I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR SINCE BEFORE I WAS BORN ON THIS GRAND ESTATE. IT WASN'T MUCH, JUST AN EPISTLE DISCREETLY DELIVERED BY THE MILKMAID, JUST ONE MAGICAL SENTENCE IN THE MIDST OF HIS ORNATE PROCLAMATIONS OF LOVE. "" JOAN, DARLING, MEET ME IN OUR PLACE. "" AS SOON AS I WAS ABLE, I RUSHED OUT TO THE HUNTING COTTAGE. I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WAS ALL HAPPENING. I HAD DREAMED THIS MOMENT WOULD COME, BUT DREAMS CAN BE SO FAR FROM WHAT IS REAL! YET THERE IT ALL WAS, ALL LAID OUT FOR ME. JOAN, MY BLOSSOM, FORGIVE ME, WHEN MY FATHER-- I WAS A COWARD, JOAN! I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT, BUT I'VE RETURNED! I COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU! I WILL BE A COWARD NO LONGER! MY CHANCE TO ESCAPE. MARRY ME, JOAN! PLEASE, FORGET ALL THE TROUBLES WE'VE HAD OR WILL HAVE AND JUST REMEMBER YOU AND I-- YOU AND I FROM THE BEGINNING AND TO THE END! MARRY ME, DARLING! MARRY ME! NO.  WHAT?    ROGER, DARLING, PLEASE, I WANT YOU TO LISTEN CLOSELY TO MY WORDS AND KNOW THAT I SINCERELY MEAN THEM.    I HAVE LIED TO YOU SO MANY TIMES, BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW, THAT EVERYONE KNOWS, WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY --THIS IS NOT A LIE. JOAN, I DON'T… WHAT? I WILL NEVER MARRY YOU. EVER. THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO CHANGE MY MIND, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? NOTHING. AND I NEVER LOVED YOU, POOR BOY. NEVER. NOT FOR A SINGLE MOMENT. JOAN! YOU… YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING! I AM SORRY, ROGER, I AM. DEEPLY. AND NOT JUST FOR THE RUSE. BUT ALSO FOR… I'M JUST SO SORRY FOR EVERYTHING THAT… FROM OUTSIDE, I HEAR THE CLICK, THE HAMMER BEING PULLED BACK ON HIS PISTOL. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? OH ROGER. YOU POOR THING. I AM USED TO IT BY NOW. #GUHH! WITH ROGER BLEEDING BEHIND ME, I COCK THE SHOTGUN AND READY MY NERVES. IT HAS BEEN A LONG, ARDUOUS JOURNEY FROM CHILDHOOD TO HERE, BUT I EXPECTED NOTHING LESS ON… WHAT… WHAT THE BLOODY @%@$ IS GOING ON? SHUT THE FUCK UP, ROGER! YOU'RE ALREADY FUCKING DEAD! LET ME WORRY ABOUT THE LIVING! FOLLOW THE PATTERN. TEN TIMES OUT OF TEN, HE HITS ME ON THE FIRST SHOT. AND IF I DON'T DIE RIGHT AWAY, HE CHECKS THE KILL AND SHOOTS AGAIN. JUST WAIT. HAVE PATIENCE. JOAN… I… I… AM HURT… HE'S COMING. ROGER! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? SHUT THE FUCK UP. SERIOUSLY. HE'S COMING. THE COWBOY'S HERE. JOAN, DARLING… TELL MOTHER… TELL HER I LOVED… I'M USED TO THE KICKBACK. FUCK YOU! I KNOW I HAVE A SECOND SHOT. YOU HEAR, COWBOY?! GO FUCK YOURSELF! I KNOW HOW TO LOAD IT. YOU CAN FEEL WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE FUCKING SHOT FOR ONCE! YOU WAKE UP SOME OTHER FUCKING PLACE, SOME OTHER FUCKING TIME! THANKS TO ROGER. I CAN'T DIE, JOAN… I'M… I'M THE HEIR… THEY DEPEND ON… THE WHOLE VILLAGE… DEPENDS… JOAN… I'M SO… WET… GOOD AND KIND ROGER. THAT'S ENOUGH. IF YOU DON'T SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH, ROGER, I'M GOING TO USE THIS GUN TO BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF YOUR BLOODY-- HE SHOULD BE DEAD. THE COWBOY'S DEAD. I DID IT. AFTER ALL THESE LIVES. AND STILL, THE BULLETS RIP THROUGH ME. NO! #NNNNN… JOAN! JOAN? D-DARLING JOAN? AH, HELL. HOWDY. WHO'S HE? I… I… SIR, I… I AM ROGER HENRY CHARLES ANGSTROM… THE… FUTURE… ELEVENTH LORD OF WEST… WESTSHIRE… WHO… PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, ROGER. ANY FRIEND OF JOAN'S IS A FRIEND OF MINE. HELL OF A GIRL, THAT JOANIE, AIN'T SHE? SHE GROWS ON YOU FAST, I'LL SAY THAT. WHAT… I DON'T… WHAT? GIVE ME A SECOND HERE, ROGER, WON'T YOU? I GOT A MESSAGE I GOT TO DELIVER TO JOAN, I DOUBT SHE'LL HEAR IT IN HER STATE, BUT I GAVE MY WORD TO A GOOD WOMAN AND I MEAN TO KEEP IT. JOAN, YOU REMEMBER, DON'T YOU? LOVE IS-- JOAN! MY DARLING! ROGER, NOW WHAT IN ALL TARNATION ARE YOU DOING THERE? IF YOU SCREAM LIKE THAT, ALL LOUD LIKE, YOU THINK JOAN'S GOING TO HEAR A DAMN THING I HAVE TO SAY? THIS IS IMPORTANT, BOY, KEEP YOUR LIPS TIED. I MEAN, JESUS, ROGER. DON'T-- HEY, COWBOY… DIDN'T YOU HEAR…? THE HUNT'S DONE. THERE. #NNNN… WHAT… YOU'RE HURT… WE'RE… OH JOAN… OH GOD…  WHAT… WHAT HAS HAPPENED… I'M DYING… JOAN… WE'RE… DYING… I THOUGHT… I CAME TO TELL YOU… WE SHOULD BE… I LOVE YOU… I LOVE… I LOVE YOU… JOAN… MY

SHIT… YEAH, I GUESS. SLOW DOWN, KING… THE BEST OF THE BEST HASN'T SEEN A SINGLE GHOST YET. JUST A MATTER OF TIME. THE TRASK MANSION IS DEEP WITH SPIRITS. WE NEED TO BE HERE AT NIGHT. THAT WOULD MAKE SENSING THE LOST SOULS MUCH EASIER. THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, HONEY. YOU KNOW JACKSON'S RULE: WE'RE DONE AT SUNSET. THIS IS STRICTLY A DAYLIGHT GIG. Y'KNOW, I DON'T HEAR ANY BETTER IDEAS. IN FACT, I'M HEARING NONE, AND I THINK ALL THIS GHOST STUFF IS NONSENSE, BUT I WANT TO GET PAID. REAL OR NOT REAL. OH, THEY'RE REAL ALRIGHT. AND THIS PLACE IS FOR SURE HAUNTED. BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE ALL STILL ALIVE AND BREATHING. WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN? KING HAS AN IDEA. JUST SMALL TALK.

OUR INSTRUMENTS HAVE GOT DIDDLY, AND ANDY DIDN'T SEE ANY GHOSTS ON THE CAMERA. IF THEY'RE HERE, THEY'RE HIDING. WHAT SHE SAID. HAS ANYONE TALKED TO MY BROTHER? WE LOST THE SIGNAL AND HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM SINCE. HE'S PROBABLY WATCHING US ALL MAKE ASSES OF OURSELVES IN THE VIEWING ROOM. BUT NO ONE HAS CHECKED ON HIM? OH, THAT'S JUST GRAND. JOE! JOE? WHAT THE HELL? THIS PLACE IS A MESS! WHERE'S MY BROTHER?! DON'T WORRY, JAY. THERE HAS TO BE A REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR-- FUCK YOUR REASONING, KING. YOU COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT US OR THIS GIG.

AND I'M NOT SAYING WE'RE GOING TO TRY IT, BUT GIVE ME THE LOWDOWN. TO EVEN ATTEMPT MAGIC THAT STRONG WE NEED TO FIND THE ROOM WHERE THE EVIL IS AT ITS MOST CONCENTRATED. HA, WELL… ABOUT THAT. REMEMBER THAT SECRET PASSAGEWAY I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU ABOUT? YOU SAW A GATEWAY TO HELL?! THAT'S WHAT I SAID, ISN'T IT? IT WAS PROBABLY A HALLUCINATION FROM THE DECADE-OLD DUST OR CHEMICALS IN THE WALLS. YOU WERE JUST TRIPPING, TRICK. NO. SOMETHING REALLY BAD HAPPENED HERE. AS OPPOSED TO THE REST OF THE HOUSE? RIGHT. PERFECT. WHAT WAS SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS ONE ROOM? TRICK… WHAT WERE YOU DOING BEFORE YOU CAME IN HERE? JACKSON… YOU KNOW THIS PLACE IS A BIT OF A LEGEND IN OUR CIRCLES… COLLECTING FOR THE BLACK MARKET THEN? THAT WOULD DO IT. BY TRYING TO STEAL FROM THE TRASK MANSION, HE UNLOCKED SOMETHING PRIMAL. WHATEVER CREATED THE EVIL IN THIS PLACE STARTED IN THIS ROOM. HOW ABOUT IT THEN, PSYCHIC? CAN YOU GET A FEEL FOR ANY GHOSTLY GUESTS? IF IT WERE NIGHTFALL MY POWERS WOULD BE MORE IN TUNE WITH THE SPIRITS. IT MIGHT BE BEST IF WE WAITED AND-- OH, COME ON NOW. THAT IS SUCH A LOAD OF BULLSHIT. WE GOT YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEEDED.

You get used to it.   The outside is really no different than being inside. Need to watch your back… And find ways to keep yourself busy. Books take up. most of my time. Only problem is that a lot of the books' pages have been ripped out to pass notes or roll joints. Not knowing how Harry Potter ends isn't what bugs me… It's never stealing a kiss. Going to the movies. Road trips. So many things I took for granted. But really, the worst part is… The food. Three squares of ass. Not quite the same as eating caviar off a supermodel's tits. The only thing that gets me through this is the reminder… … that someday… I'm going to die. #AHHH! STOP! OH DAMN, SON. YOU HEAR THAT? MUST BE A RIOT. NAH NAH, WINTERS, THAT'S MY HOMIES COME TO BUST ME OUT. NO, NO, PLEASE GOD, NO… WHOA, WHOA! JACKSON T. WINTERS… IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY. ALMOST. CAN YOU BEHAVE, WINTERS? #HM HM. DON'T TRY ANYTHING FUNNY. THE PRISON RIOT IS STILL WELL UNDERWAY, AND IT'LL BE SOME TIME BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW YOU'RE GONE. YOUR VOICE… SAME BROAD FROM THE PRISON? MY NAME IS ANDERSON LAKE. ANDERSON, HUNH? ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS EVER CALL YOU ANDY? ONLY THE DEAD ONES. WHERE THE HELL ARE WE? THIS IS THE COLLECTION ROOM OF MARKUS SCHRECKEN. THAT'S A MOUTHFUL. MISTER SCHRECKEN HIRED ME TO… RETRIEVE YOU. YOU MIND PUTTING THE BLADE AWAY? I'VE GOT A THING. OF COURSE YOU DO. SO WHAT DOES RICHIE RICH WANT WITH LITTLE OLD ME? I WANT YOU TO STEAL A GHOST. COME AGAIN? AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE A REASONABLY EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION OF SUPERNATURAL ARTIFACTS, AND YET IT'S MISSING… A KEY PIECE. SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE THE REST LOOK LIKE PETTY KNICK-KNACKS. I'M NOT HEARING ANYTHING THAT RELATES TO ME, MARKUS. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE TRASK MANSION? THE HOME OF THE FAMOUS TRASK-- YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW THE SCORE. ""BUNCH OF OLD RICH FUCKS, JUST LIKE YOU, GOT BORED 60-SOMETHING YEARS AGO AND STARTED KILLING PEOPLE AT THEIR STATELY MANOR. "" THE GUARDS LET US WATCH THE DATELINE SPECIAL ON THAT MASS CULT SUICIDE THAT HAPPENED THERE BACK IN THE 70S. THAT BLOODY MESS BARELY SCRATCHES THE SURFACE. NEARLY A HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED OR GONE MISSING IN THAT HOUSE. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THE TRASK FAMILY HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE OCCULT AND MYSTICAL… THE TRASK MANSION SCREAMS HAUNTED AND-- MARKUS, COULD YOU SPEED THIS UP AND GET TO THE "" BUT. "" ##SIGH.# BUT IN TWO WEEKS TIME IT'S SCHEDULED TO BE DESTROYED, SOME SORT OF MINI-MALL OR PUBLIC PARK OR SOME OTHER RUBBISH. I WANT YOU TO FIND OUT IF IT'S TRULY HAUNTED AND BRING BACK A REAL GHOST FOR MY COLLECTION. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. RIGHT. YOU FAKED A RIOT TO BREAK ME OUT… SO I CAN STEAL CASPER? LET ME ASK YOU THIS REAL QUICK… ARE YOU INSANE? THAT'S DEBATABLE. AT LEAST YOU'RE HONEST. WHY NOT JUST HAVE LITTLE MISS HOMEWRECKER OVER HERE DO THE JOB? OH COME NOW, GIVE YOURSELF MORE CREDIT. BEFORE YOUR INCARCERATION YOU WERE THE BEST AT THIS SORT OF THING. AN ARTIST. IF YOU KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT ME AS YOU CLAIM, THEN YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT ME ANYMORE. RETIRED FOR NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS. AFTER YOUR TEAM TRIED TO STEAL FROM THAT CASINO, I KNOW. IT WAS… ""TRAGIC."" THAT'S ONE WAY TO PUT IT. ALL MY FRIENDS DEAD. YES, WELL… GET ME MY GHOST AND I'LL MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE SAFE ON MY PRIVATE ISLAND WITH ALL THE MONEY YOU'D EVER NEED. FOREVER. WHAT IF I SAY NO? ANDERSON WILL RETURN YOU TO PRISON. LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. #HM. I'M NOT GOING BACK. THEN WE'RE IN AGREEMENT? WHATEVER. BUT JUST ONE OTHER THING FIRST… YOU FEEL THAT?! IT'S PAIN! THAT'S ALL THERE IS! PAIN THEN DEATH! IF BY SOME CHANCE THERE IS AN AFTERLIFE AND THERE REALLY ARE GHOSTS… WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LEAVE THEM-- ALONE?! STOP. NOW! ANDERSON… IT'S FINE. I EXPECTED THIS. IT SEEMS THE ONCE GREAT JACKSONT. WINTERS WOULD PREFER TO DIE IN PRISON. I NEVER SAID THAT. DIDN'T HAVE TO. THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ON YOUR LAST JOB, GIVES YOU AWAY. YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THIS ISN'T YOUR SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE, MISTER WINTERS. IT'S YOUR LAST. I WANT A NEW SUIT. TAILOR-MADE. NAVY BLUE. ' 50S STYLE. SOMETHING SINATRA WOULD HAVE WORN. THEN I WANT A RUSSIAN PROSTITUTE WITH BIG ONES. I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE FAKE OR NOT. OR IF SHE IS REALLY RUSSIAN. SHE JUST NEEDS TO HAVE THE ACCENT. AND THE CREW IS MY CALL. THAT'S THE DEAL. OH, AND I'M GOING TO NEED A SHAVE. DONE AND DONE. ANDERSON WILL ACCOMPANY YOU TO GUARANTEE YOU DON'T GO ON THE RUN. SURE, FINE, WHATEVER. BUT LIKE I SAID… I PICK THE REST OF THE TEAM. MISTER WINTERS… MY REPUTATION IS FAMOUS AMONG THE VERY BEST SUPERNATURAL PROFESSIONALS AND I ALREADY HAVE A LIST OF NAMES WHO ARE PERFECT TO HELP YOU-- NO. EXCUSE ME? YOU HEARD ME. IT'S YOUR MONEY, BUT IT'S MY PLAN AND MY PLAYERS. AND I KNOW JUST THE RIGHT PEOPLE FOR THE JOB… Oliver King. Specialty? Detecting bullshit. Met him in Detroit when he was just a kid. Only person to ever come close to picking my pocket. Been a fan of his career ever since. I'LL FEAST ON YOUR SOUL! DROP THE EMO ACT, KID. GET A LIFE, GET LAID AND GROW THE FUCK UP. AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT… GET SOME SUN. THAT ISN'T REALLY MY STYLE, Y'KNOW? IT FLIES IN THE FACE OF EVERYTHING I'M ABOUT. EXACTLY. Robby Trick. Old school stage magician. His history with finding occult artifacts on the black market is what I'm interested in. He helped me sell a few hot items from that gig in Istanbul. FOR MY NEXT ILLUSION… SHIT, I MESSED UP. ONE SECOND. YOU WANT TO DO WHAT NOW? IT PAYS A-- I'M IN. Jay and Joe Burns. Ghost Trappers. Famous for catching multiple ""spirits"" on tape. Knew their dad. He was the best tech man in the biz. I'm thinking his sons can do the same. WITH THIS MANY DECEASED CITIZENS IN THE SAME PLACE, YOU ARE BOUND TO GET AT LEAST ONE POLTERGEIST… DUDE, YOU SEE THAT? WHAT IS THAT? ZOOM IN. SINCE YOU KNEW OUR POPS… WE'RE DOWN. BUT OUR CREW IS COMING, AND WE ARE FILMING EVERYTHING. WHATEVER. AS LONG AS YOU DO YOUR JOBS AND NEVER AIM A CAMERA AT ME, I DON'T CARE. … YOU KNOW THERE IS ONE MORE PERSON WE NEED, RIGHT? WITHOUT HER WE MIGHT AS WELL CALL IT QUITS RIGHT NOW. I KNOW. DAMMIT. I CAN SEE HIM, RUTH. OH MY WORD… THOMAS… CAN YOU HEAR ME…? Edzia Rusnak. Super psychic and medium to people with deep pockets. One of Schrecken's choices. I don't trust her. THOMAS IS SINGING REO SPEEDWAGON'S "" CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING. "" THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? THAT'S OUR SONG! THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WHAT A LOAD. MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET ME DO THE TALKING. I CAN STILL GET THE JOB DONE, ANDERSON. EVERYONE SAYS YOU'RE THE BEST. IF THAT'S TRUE, THERE IS NO POINT IN LYING TO YOU. I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT ON BOARD WITH THIS MUMBO JUMBO AND- BEFORE YOU CAN STEAL A GHOST FROM THE TRASK MANSION YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME THERE. HOW DID YOU…? GUESS I'M YOUR GIRL. NOBODY'S SHOWING, WINTERS. MAYBE THEY DIDN'T LIKE YOUR PLAN. LOOKS LIKE OUR NEXT STOP WILL BE BACK TO THE PRISON. Y'KNOW, EVERY TIME YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH… I GET AN ERECTION. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.  HERE WE GO. WE REALLY GONNA DO THIS, BOSS? JUST LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT AT OUR LITTLE MEET AND GREET… FIRST THINGS FIRST… BE PROFESSIONAL. WE NEED TO PLAY THIS SMART, AND THAT MEANS SCOPING OUT THE JOINT FIRST. IF WE DO THIS MISSION AS WE PLANNED, WE'LL ALL GET TO WALK AWAY A LOT RICHER. NOW, C'MON, WE DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN. HOLY CRAP, THIS IS UNREAL. YEAH, YEAH, REAL SPOOKY… C'MON, HUSTLE. DAYLIGHT'S BURNING, PEOPLE. FIRST RULE OF BREAKING AND ENTERING… THE FRONT DOOR IS PROBABLY UNLOCKED. NICE. OKAY, LISTEN UP. BAD THINGS HAPPEN HERE AT NIGHT, SO WHEN THE SUN SETS, WE'RE OUT. REMEMBER, THIS IS JUST AN EXPLORATORY MISSION. THIS ISN'T THE WINCHESTER HOUSE. THE HOUSE'S BLUEPRINTS WERE AT THE CITY OFFICE. EVERYONE GETS A COPY, SO NO EXCUSES IF YOU GET LOST. DON'T BE STUPID. I'LL GIVE THIS A QUICK ONCE-OVER. OLD MANSIONS LIKE THIS ARE ALWAYS FULL OF SURPRISES.

JUST GO AHEAD AND KILL ME. I AIN'T TALKING. PUT THIS ON HIM. YES, EL SILBÓN. TORTURE? NO. TORTURE IS NOT THE BROTHER OF THE CLOSED BOOK'S STYLE. BEEN THERE. DONE THAT. THE BROTHERHOOD HAS NO TIME FOR THOSE KINDS OF GAMES. WE DEAL… IN FEAR. AH! DAMN! JESUS… WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP SHOOTING AT ME? HAVEN'T EVEN HEALED FROM THE LAST TIME… AH, BUT YOU SEE… NOT A MARK ON YOU, JACKSON. THE ONLY THING THAT WILL BE BRUISED IS YOUR EGO. EVERYBODY NEEDS A WAY TO GET THEIR JOLLIES OFF. BUT I'M STILL NOT GIVING UP ANY INFO, SILBÓN. AH WELL, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE DARKNESS. THE DARKNESS? WHY WOULD I BE AFRAID OF THE DARK? EXACTLY. OH HO… THIS IS GETTING INTERESTING. I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT THEY'D TORTURE YOU, BUT "" THE DARKNESS "" IS JUST SO OMINOUS AND FUN SOUNDING. STOP. THIS ONE IS UNUSUAL. HE IS… HAUNTED. TAKE HIM TO SEE… EL MAESTRO DE LA MUERTE. YOU HEARD THE MAN, YOU LUCKY DOG. THE DARKNESS WOULD HAVE HAD YOU SHITTING YOUR PANTS. BUT AFTER EL MAESTRO IS THROUGH WITH YOU, YOU'LL BE BEGGING TO GIVE UP YOUR COHORTS. AND THEN… "" THEY WILL DIE. "" JACKSON IS PROBABLY SIX FEET UNDER BY NOW, TRICK. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT, SKINNER. ONE OF JACKSON'S SPECIAL TALENTS IS SURVIVING. BUT IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO RESCUE NINA AND RETURN HER TO WENONA BLOOD CROW, WE NEED TO GET IN THERE. AND I DON'T SEE ANY EASY ACCESS. ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE GUARDS. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. #UK! #GAH! A BIT NOISIER THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED. NOW WE HAVE A HOLE INTO THIS CASTLE, BUT ONCE INSIDE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ALL OVER US… I HAVE AN IDEA. BEEN A WHILE SINCE I WENT TO A HALLOWEEN PARTY. #EH? SO MY HOPE IS THAT THIS MAESTRO GUY IS LIKE SOME KIND OF BOND VILLAIN AND HE FEEDS YOU TO ANGRY, GIANT MUTANT SNAKES. Me too, Anderson. EVER SLEEP WITH A WOMAN WHO HAS A GHOST TRAPPED INSIDE HER, MY FRIEND? CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE. YOU COULDN'T HANDLE IT. THE SCRATCHES ALONE WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR YOUR TENDER SKIN. I wish they'd execute me just so I wouldn't have to listen to this guy go on and ON, but I need to find Nina. There she is. She sees me, too. Worried. YOU HAVE A VISITOR, MAESTRO. She didn't want me to take her back to Wenona. Something about an evil spirit. But I don't care. She's coming with me. Before things can get any worse around here. AH, SO THIS IS THE GENTLEMAN I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT. COME TO LIBERATE ONE OF OUR POSSESSED, HERO? YES, SNAKES! I'M NO HERO. NO… NO, YOU'RE NOT, ARE YOU? YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY. BUT YOU'RE BEING FOLLOWED. FROM THE OTHER WORLD. ONE WHO STANDS NEAR YOU. A WOMAN. AND ANOTHER WHOSE HANDS ARE DIPPED IN BLOOD. AND THEN A POWERFUL SPECTER CLOAKED IN BLACK, WHO HAS AN INTEREST IN YOUR PATH. MANY SPIRITS ARE STUDYING YOUR EVERY MOVE, JACKSON. WHY IS THAT? NO IDEA, BUT IF THEY'RE REALLY WATCHING ME, THEN ALL THEY'VE SEEN IS A WHOLE LOT OF MASTURBATING. HA. YOU'RE ENTERTAINING, JACKSON. COME. ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU THE TOUR. YOU MUST THINK WE ARE MONSTERS, TAKING THESE WOMEN FROM THEIR HOMES. YOU COULD SAY THAT, YEAH. BUT THEY SEEM TO ENJOY THEMSELVES HERE. WHAT'S THE REAL DEAL? LONG GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN WOMEN HAVING THEIR SOULS OVERTAKEN IS SEEN AS A BURDEN. WE EMPOWER THESE YOUNG LADIES TO FIND A BETTER PURPOSE WITH THEIR GIFTS. WHEN THEY HAVE AN… EPISODE… WE PUT THEM TO WORK. WORK DOING WHAT, EXACTLY? ARE THEY WRITING? BOOK OF THE DEAD. NECRONOMICON. THE CODEX. GRIMOIRE. WHATEVER YOU MAY CHOOSE TO CALL THEM, THEY ARE CREATED HERE. THE BOOKS ARE BOUND AND THEN SOLD. DIFFERENT RELIGIONS. DIFFERENT SPIRITS. DIFFERENT BUYERS. OUR BOOKS ARE DISTRIBUTED ALL AROUND THE WORLD. LIKE GIDEON'S "" BOOKS OF THE DEAD? "" IF THAT MAKES IT EASIER FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND, YES. THEY CAN ONLY BE WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO ARE POSSESSED BY GHOSTS. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE GIRLS STOP… PRODUCING? WE USE THEIR FLESH FOR THE BOOK BINDING. BUT IF WE NEED TO REMOVE THE GHOSTS… MY TOTEM. FOUND WITHIN THESE HAUNTED HALLS, THIS LITTLE BABY HAS THE ABILITY TO FREE THESE DIRTY GIRLS OF THE GHOSTS THAT INHABIT THEIR TENDER FORMS. NOW, I'M SORRY TO SAY, BUT I CAN'T RID YOU PERMANENTLY OF WHAT HAUNTS YOU. HOWEVER, I CAN OFFER… I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING, JACKSON. YOU'RE GOING TO STEAL THE TOTEM, AREN'T YOU? THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING I'M GOING TO DO TO THIS CREEPY OLD BASTARD. TEMPORARY RELIEF! #WHOA... HURRY IT UP, FELLAS. JULIET CAN ONLY BUY US SO MUCH TIME. AND YOU THINK REMINDING US OF THAT EVERY FIVE SECONDS IS GOING TO MAKE US GO FASTER? OH, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? LISTEN, I HIRE A MAN TO DO THE JOB, I LET THEM DO THE JOB. IF WE PULL THIS OFF, WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO WORK A DAY OF OUR LIVES AGAIN, SO EXCUSE ME IF I'M A BIT IMPATIENT. BUT IF BLOOD CROW CATCHES US HERE, WE'LL BE… JACKSON!!! HEY, BOSSMAN. THERE'S A PROBLEM, I THINK. SOMETHING WEIRD IS GOING DOWN IN THIS PLACE. THAT'S JULIET WOODS… IS THIS ---? IT IS. THIS IS YOUR LAST GIG… I'M GOING TO SEE HOW THIS REALLY PLAYED OUT. GET THE TRUTH TO YOUR DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS, JACKSON. THAT'S JUST BUTTERFLIES, BABY. DON'T GET SPOOKED. AND THERE WE ARE. THAT WILL KEEP THAT BLOODY BANSHEE AWAY FROM YOUR FOCUS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO. WHY'RE YOU HELPING ME IF YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU? BECAUSE I BELIEVE YOU CAN BE ONE OF US. YEAH, WHAT NOW? A MAN LIKE YOU, SO IN TOUCH WITH THE UNDEAD… WE'D LIKE FOR YOU TO JOIN US. BECOME ONE OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE CLOSED BOOK. WELL, YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN, SHORTY. GIVE ME A MINUTE TO THINK ABOUT IT. WAIT. NO, DON'T NEED A MINUTE. THE ANSWER IS NO. HELL NO. THAT'S A SHAME. TAKE HIM TO THE DARKNESS! JACKSON! ABOUT DAMN TIME! IF I'D KNOWN THEY WERE ABOUT TO KILL YOU, I WOULD HAVE WAITED. WHERE'S NINA?! NEARBY, BUT WE'VE GOT TROUBLE! CAN YOU TAKE THIS VILE THING AWAY FROM ME, PLEASE? SUCH A PUSSY. SAY CHEESE, YA OLD FART! NO ONE EVER LAYS A HAND ON EL MAESTRO. ESPECIALLY NOT SOME PETTY THIEF. THAT'S FOR THE BULLETPROOF VEST! IF ANY HARM COMES TO EL MAESTRO, I WILL HAVE YOUR HEADS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! LEAVE US ALONE! NINA! TIME TO GO HOME, LITTLE GIRL. YOUR FAMILY MISSES YOU! NO! I WON'T LET YOU HAVE IT! NINA! WAIT! WE HAVE TO GET HER. JACKSON HAS IT UNDER CONTROL. HE KNOWS THE RENDEZVOUS AND WILL MEET US. TRUST HIM! WE ARE SUPER OUTNUMBERED AND NEED TO GO. NOW! #GRRR. FINE. DAMMIT, NINA, STOP! NO! I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU. YOU DON'T KNOW ME, BUT YOU CAN TRUST ME. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU'RE THE MAN WHO TRIED TO ROB FROM MY FAMILY. I WAS YOUNG, BUT I REMEMBER. IT'S YOUR FAULT. WENONA PUT THIS, THIS… THING INSIDE OF ME BECAUSE OF YOU. WHAT THING? IT'S NOT JUST A GHOST? IT'S AN EVIL WITCH… "" THE SKADEGMUTC. "" THE SKADEGMUTC IS CREATED AFTER AN EVIL SHAMAN DIES BUT REFUSES TO GO TO THE LIGHT. THEY ARE THE THINGS NIGHTMARES ARE MADE OF. "" THEIR POWER ALLOWS THEM TO CURSE ANY WHO CROSS THEIR PATH. WHEN YOU TRIED TO TAKE FROM US, YOU UNLEASHED THE EVIL SPIRITS IN OUR CASINO. YEAH. WORST DAY OF MY LIFE, I REMEMBER. WENONA BELIEVED SHE COULD DO IT AGAIN. BUT THIS TIME SHE COULD HARNESS A WITCH, THE SKADEGMUTC, AND USE IT FOR HER OWN PERSONAL GAIN. WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED WENONA LIED TO ME? SO SHE… CONJURED UP THE SPIRIT OF AN EVIL WITCH AND THEN WHAT? SHE TRIED TO PLACE IT INSIDE OF SKINNER. SKINNER WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE EVIL. BUT INSTEAD IT CHOSE ME. C'MON THEN. WHERE ARE WE GOING? CIVILIZATION FOR A START. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO WENONA OR BACK TO THE TEMPLE. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN A PRISON, AND IT WASN'T A WALK IN THE PARK. SO I'M NOT GOING TO SENTENCE SOMEONE ELSE TO THE SAME BULLSHIT FATE. I HAVE SOME LEFTOVER CONNECTIONS THAT WON'T TURN US IN. THEY'LL HOOK US UP WITH NEW IDENTITIES AND WE'LL GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS. BE FREE. BUT THE JUNGLE. IT'S DANGEROUS.

YOU REALLY THINK THAT KIND OF FUN WOULDN'T COME WITH A COST? NOTHING IS FREE. NOTHING AND NO ONE. YOU WANT TO DANCE, YOU GOTTA PAY THE BAND, HONEY. WHAT'RE YOU RAMBLING ABOUT?! THEY WERE GOING TO TURN YOUR SKIN INTO BOOK COVERS WHEN THEY WERE DONE WITH YOU! WHAT? OH, YOU DIDN'T KNOW? THAT DAMN CULT MAKES YOU WRITE THEIR BLOODY BOOKS OF THE DEAD AND THEN… AND THEN… AFTER YOUR BODY IS BURNED OUT BY THE LOVELY GHOSTS INSIDE YOU, THEY TURN YOUR FLESH INTO PAPER. FLESH PAPER! BUT… I NEED A DRINK. YOU AND ME BOTH. BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF THIS JUNGLE. RATHER NOT BE DESSERT FOR SOME GHOSTLY WILDLIFE. THEY'RE AFRAID OF THE SKADEGAMUTC INSIDE ME. UNSURE WHAT TO THINK OF IT. THEY WON'T ATTACK… YET. THAT'S THE GHOST THAT POSSESSED YOU? I'VE SEEN MY FAIR SHARE OF POSSESSED PEOPLE, AND YOU'RE NOT LOOKING THE TYPE.

YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP THAT IN CHECK LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO GET YOU EXORCISED? MAYBE. AS LONG AS I FOCUS. THE GHOST HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO TAKE HOLD OF ME YET. IT'S LIKE A SLEEPING GIANT JUST WAITING TO BE AWAKENED. WENONA BLOOD CROW… USED TO BE ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. SHE COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT OUR HERITAGE. JUST A WAY TO GUILT THE WHITE FOLKS INTO GAMBLING MORE. BUT AFTER SHE SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU AND YOUR LAST CREW, SHE BECAME A BELIEVER. STARTED TO RESEARCH THE OLD WAYS OF OUR PEOPLE.

"" A TIME WHEN THE SKIES WERE CLOUDED WITH EVIL, AND THE OCEANS ROILED WITH DEATH. "" "" ACCORDING TO RECORD, "" FOR MANY YEARS, MAN WAS PREYED UPON LIKE FISH IN A STREAM. "" BUT THEN, SOMETIME AROUND 12,000 BC, A HERO ROSE. A MAN NAMED HURIN. HE TAUGHT HIS PEOPLE TO BAND TOGETHER, AND FIGHT THE ABOMINATION. ” "" THE VASSALS… "" "" YES. THERE'S RECORD IN THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS OF THAT FORMATION. AN ORGANIZATION OF BROTHERS OF LIGHT, OUT TO FIGHT A COALITION OF DARKNESS… "" WE WERE FORMED TO FIGHT HIM, THE BEAST, AND HIS MINIONS. AND FOR YEARS HURIN FOUGHT. UNTIL, ONE DAY, HE DEVISED A PLAN. "" HE MADE SOMETHING CALLED THE ISKAKKU, THE GREAT WEAPON. "" "" A WEAPON? "" "" A MEANS OF DESTROYING THE BEAST. AND WITH THIS WEAPON, WE WERE ABLE TO BEAT THE BEAST BACK. WE DESTROYED ITS ARMY AND WE BROKE IT. WE HAD IT… IT WAS AS GOOD AS DEAD. "" ALL BECAUSE OF THIS HERO, HURIN. "" WELL, WHY NOT RING HIM UP, THIS GREAT HERO? WHERE IS HE? ... IT'S HIM, ISN'T IT? THE TRADER. HE'S… HEH. I'D HEARD YOU WERE SHARP, MS. JONES. AGENT HOBBES. HE SAID GOOD THINGS. THE GRAY TRADER ISN'T HIS MONIKER. THAT'S JUST THE BASTARDIZATION OF IT. HIS ORIGINAL TITLE WAS "" THE GREAT TRAITOR. "" WE ENTRUSTED HURIN WITH KILLING THE BEAST… BUT IT TURNED HIM. AND AFTER BEATING IT BACK… … HE SUCKLED FROM IT, AND HE BECAME ITS GREAT PROTECTOR. HE IS THE TRUE JUDAS. THE WORST VILLAIN IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND. "" THREE TIMES SINCE THAT FIRST WAR, THE GRAY TRADER HAS PLANTED THE BEAST IN THE EARTH AND TRIED TO NURTURE IT TO HEALTH. "" THE LAST ATTEMPT HAPPENED NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN WHAT WAS THEN BASHKIR TERRITORY--CENTRAL RUSSIA TODAY. AND IT WAS NEARLY SUCCESSFUL. BUT USING HURIN'S WEAPON, WE DEFEATED THE BEAST. "" WE THOUGHT WE'D DESTROYED IT THAT TIME, AND THE TRADER, TOO. "" THEN, DURING THE EARLY 17005, RUMORS SURFACED THAT THE BEAST MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED HERE, AND THAT THE TRADER WAS ATTEMPTING TO SINK IT SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA. "" WHEN AGENT HOBBES TOOK OVER, HE BUILT THIS PLACE AND OVERSAW THE CONSTRUCTION OF A BASE IN THE NEVADA DESERT, A SECRET BASE HARDLY ANYONE IN THE VMS KNEW ABOUT. ALL IN SERVICE OF FINDING THE BEAST'S LAIR, SHOULD IT TRULY BE HERE, IN AMERICA. "" IN THE BIGGEST COUP OF ALL, HOBBES WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE THE RUSSIANS TO LOAN US THE ISKAKKU, THE GREAT WEAPON, TO BE HOUSED IN THIS DESERT BASE, IN CASE THE RUMORS SHOULD BE TRUE. "" HOBBES AND THE MILITARY INSTITUTED AN AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM OF UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR DETONATIONS THROUGHOUT THE 1950s. "" THEY WERE CALLED ' TESTS', BUT THEY WERE STRIKES. ATTEMPTS TO KILL THE BEAST. "" AND WE WERE GETTING CLOSE. WE ALMOST HAD HIM… ""… BUT THEN IT ALL WENT TO SHIT IN DALLAS. "" AFTER KENNEDY, JOHNSON CAME IN AND DECLARED WAR ON US. HE'S NO BELIEVER IN MONSTERS, AND PARANOID TO BOOT. SO HE CUT US OFF. "" BUT THE ISKAKKU, THE GREAT WEAPON, IT'S DOWN THERE, BENEATH THAT FACILITY. ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY GUARDED IN THE COUNTRY. "" AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BREAK IN, AM I RIGHT, DOLLY? I'M NOT YOUR DOLLY… AND NO, IT GETS WORSE ( DICK ). SEE, THE RUSSIANS, THEY KNOW THE BEAST IS HERE, TOO. BENEATH THE GROUND. GETTING READY TO COME OUT. AND THEY KNOW WE'RE NOT DOING JACK SHIT ABOUT IT. SO… ""… EVER HEAR OF SPUTNIK? "" THE ENTIRE SATELLITE PROGRAM IS BUILT AROUND THE RUSSIANS' DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT BEAST IS KEPT IN CHECK. IF THEY SEE ANY SIGN OF IT, ANY SIGN THAT THE ISKAKKU IS DISMANTLED… THEY'LL DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE. "" YOU'RE TALKING… I'M TALKING BOOM. FULL-SCALE NUCLEAR ATTACK. BUT WE'D RETALIATE. IT'D BE WORLDWIDE DESTRUCTION. THEY'D TAKE THAT RISK TO STOP THE BEAST FROM GETTING OUT. SO… WELCOME TO THE REAL COLD WAR, PEOPLE. I NEED A TEAM OF SIX TO PULL THIS OFF.

"" YOU SAID YOU NEED A TEAM OF SIX, BUT THERE ARE NINE OF US HERE. WELL, LIKE I SAID IT GETS WORSE… SEE, I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT THE VASSALS HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED. THE TONGUE IS EVERYWHERE.

ONLY SMALL ACTORS. THAT WAS ME. A SMALL ACTRESS, WHO HATED THE ROLES AVAILABLE TO HER. SO NOW I MAKE MY OWN ROLES. I MAKE MY OWN RULES, TOO. ROLE OF A LIFETIME. THE TEVINTER CITY OF VENTUS. ALSO OFTEN REFERRED TO BY ITS PREVIOUS NAME, QARINUS. APPARENTLY THE CITY LIKES HAVING MULTIPLE PERSONAS. DEFINITELY A PLACE FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME. RUMOR HAS IT THAT THE QUNARI HAVE THEIR EYES ON THIS CITY. SOME SAY WAR IS IMMINENT. THAT THE CITY WILL FALL. SO THE PEOPLE OF VENTUS ARE DESPERATE. THEY NEED TO LEAVE, AND FAST. THE LAST THING THEY NEED IS TO DEAL WITH AN INQUISITIVE MAGISTER. THIS IS THE ROLE I'LL BE PLAYING IN TODAY'S PERFORMANCE. THERE'S A MAGISTER IN VENTUS NAMED QINTARA. HE HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN YEARS. BUT THEY SAY HE PRACTICES SOME DARK MAGICS. HIS SON JUST EMERGED FROM THE FAMILY ESTATE. YOUNG THING, LOCKED IN THAT ESTATE FOR SO LONG? HIGHLY UNLIKELY HE'LL KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH A MAGISTER LOOKING INTO RUMORS THAT HIS FAMILY WAS VENATORI, COLLABORATING WITH THE ELDER ONE TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD. THE ROOKIE PLAY WOULD BE TO HEAD STRAIGHT INTO A MEETING WITH THE YOUNG MAN. BUT WHEN PLAYING A ROLE LIKE THIS, YOU WANT THE REST OF THE WORLD TO SELL YOU IN THE PART. LET A FEW OF VENTUS'S MOST INFLUENTIAL AND CHATTY RESIDENTS KNOW I'M HERE. HINT AT WHY. BY THE TIME I APPROACH THE YOUNG MAN, HE'LL BE TERRIFIED. THIS ONE'S NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH. HE SEEMS THE KIND OF MAN WHO WOULD SEE THROUGH ME IN AN INSTANT. DON'T YOU HAVE A MAN FROM TEVINTER WHO CAN HANDLE THIS SORT OF THING? ADDITIONALLY, IT IS A GOOD RULE IN THIS LINE OF WORK TO NEVER DEAL WITH ANYONE WHO HAS MORE SECRETS THAN YOU DO. HE'S A WANTED MAN. WE CAN'T TAKE THAT RISK. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. THIS WHOLE TOWN IS. ALTHOUGH, NOW I'M CURIOUS. WHICH IS ALSO SOMETHING TO AVOID. MUCH LIKE RUNNING INTO FORMER MARKS. OR GETTING YOUR FEELINGS MIXED UP IN YOUR BUSINESS. HE SHOULD NOT BE HERE. HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE IN FERELDEN. I SHOULD JUST LEAVE… … OR PERHAPS I'LL JUST WORK QUICKLY. PARDON ME. ARE YOU CALIX QINTARA? I AM. AND YOU ARE…? MAGISTER ARAMIS. HAVE YOU HEARD OF ME? OF COURSE. YOUR MERCY IS KNOWN ACROSS ALL OF TEVINTER. MY… MERCY? PLEASE, DEAR MAGISTER. WE ALL KNOW THAT VENTUS IS SOON TO FALL. AND MY FATHER, HE IS ILL. OUR FAMILY'S HOLDINGS, OUR LIBRARY, EVERYTHING OF VALUE… WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT OUT OF THE CITY BEFORE THE QUNARI ATTACK. IF SOMEONE OF YOUR MERCY AND GENEROSITY WOULD ASSIST IN TRANSPORTING THESE ITEMS, THEN WHEN WE REACH SAFETY-- … YOU'LL LIQUIDATE THE HOLDINGS AND REPAY ME A HUNDRED FOLD. HEY! CUT THE ACT, CHILD. YOU ARE NO QINTARA. I BEG YOUR PARDON? YOU ARE A CON ARTIST. A GRIFTER. I KNOW THE SCAM YOU'RE PLAYING. "" THE CHASIND PRINCE, "" IT'S OFTEN CALLED. BUT I AM NOT CHASIND. YOU'RE NOT A SMART PERSON, ARE YOU? THEN I SHALL BE BLUNT. YOU ARE, EITHER BY CHOICE OR HAPPENSTANCE, A LIAR WITH NO CONNECTION TO THE RECLUSIVE HOUSE OF QINTARA. I KNOW NOTHING OF THIS CHASIND PRINCE. BUT IF YOU KNOW THAT CON BY NAME, THEN I SUSPECT YOU ARE NOT A MAGISTER. LET'S JUST SKIP THE FANCY TALK, SISTER. NEITHER OF US AIN'T WHAT WE PRETEND TO BE. YOU EXPOSE ME, I EXPOSE YOU. THAT "" FANCY TALK "" IS NOT A ROLE I PLAY, YOUNG MAN. IT'S CALLED CLASS. CLEARLY, YOU HAVE NONE. HOWEVER, YOU ARE NOT A COMPLETE IMBECILE. SO WE APPEAR TO BE AT A STALEMATE. I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM. I KEEP DOING WHAT I DO, GET SOME MONEY TO SKIP THIS TOWN BEFORE THE QUNARI INVADE… … AND YOU DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU CAME TO TOWN TO DO. THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE, AS I CAME HERE TO DO YOU. ER… PERSUADE YOU THAT I WAS A MAGISTER AND WORK THE SITUATION TO A BRIBE. I SPENT THE DAY SPREADING WORD THAT HOUSE QINTARA WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION. I CAN SHIFT TARGETS EASILY ENOUGH. BUT I AM NOW LINKED TO YOU. SO, MAYBE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. NO. NOT AN OPTION, AS YOU ARE AN AMATEUR. AND A MORON. I WILL TRY TO SALVAGE THIS SITUATION AS BEST I CAN. YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO POACH YOUR SMALL GAME. TRY NOT TO SCARE OFF THE BIG PREY. BIG PREY, HUH?   SO I TAKE A LEFT WHEN I REACH THE DOCKS…? THAT IS CORRECT. THANK YOU… EXCUSE ME, SER… … YES? I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ASSIST ME. OKAY, PERHAPS THAT WASN'T NICE. BUT I DIDN'T TELL HIM TO TRY TO SCAM THE GENTLEMAN AT THE BAR. WELL, AS I RECALL, HOUSE QINTARA WAS RUMORED TO BE IN LEAGUE WITH THE VENATORI. AS A MEMBER OF THE MAGISTERIUM, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MY DUTY TO LOOK INTO SUCH THINGS. MAGISTERIUM…? SO WHILE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELP A STRAPPING YOUNG LAD LIKE YOU ESCAPE THE CITY BEFORE ANYTHING BAD HAPPENS… … I WOULD THEN BE COMPELLED TO SEIZE ANY AND ALL ASSETS I ASSISTED IN REMOVING FROM VENTUS. ON BEHALF OF THE MAGISTERIUM. UNTIL AN INVESTIGATION RESOLVED THE ISSUE OF VENATORI INFLUENCE, OF COURSE. UM… WELL… I HAVE ALTERNATE FUNDING, SO… NOT INTERESTED? SUCH A PITY. I'D HAVE LOVED TO HELP. FOR ANDRASTE'S SAKE… RUN AWAY, YOUNG MAN. I TELL YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THE BIG PREY. YOU IMMEDIATELY GO POACHING. AND END UP FACING DOWN A MAGISTER WHO I SIMPLY ASKED FOR DIRECTIONS. AS I SAID… A MORON. AND LIKE I SAID… WE COULD WORK TOGETHER. NO. WE ARE NOT PEERS. YOU ARE A SMALL TIME GRIFTER. I AM A PROFESSIONAL. ROUGH DATE? YOU HAVE NO IDEA. AFTER WHAT SHE DID TO ME, I DON'T THINK MY FATHER--THE MAGISTER --WILL LET ME BACK INTO OUR HOME. WHAT? WHAT DID SHE DO? HEY… WE SHOULD TALK. WHAT KIND OF LADY DESTROYS THE REPUTATION OF A MAGISTER'S SON? AND WAIT… YOUR STAFF. HOW CAN THAT EVEN CONDUCT MAGICAL ENERGIES? I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT PROP-MASTER WASN'T WORTH THE COIN HE WAS PAID. I ASSURE YOU, MY STAFF IS REAL. BUT EVEN IF IT WERE FAKE… … MY MABARI IS NOT. SOMEONE'S BEEN THROUGH HERE. SEARCH FOR--URK! < NOT LONG AFTER THIS PATROL FAILS TO RETURN, THE CITY WILL KNOW WE'RE HERE. > * < THEN WE SPEED UP THE TIMETABLE. >  HOW THE FUCK…? DID I FORGET TO MENTION I TRAVEL WITH A MABARI? HER NAME IS AUTUMN. WHEN I'M IN FERELDEN, SHE'S DESCENDED FROM THE MABARI WHO FOUGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE HERO OF FERELDEN. IN THE FREE MARCHES, SHE WAS A GIFT FROM THE HAWKE FAMILY. BUT WHEREVER I GO, SHE IS QUITE HANDY AT DE-ESCALATING A BAD SITUATION. CAREFUL. SHE BITES. WHAT NOW? WE KEEP TRYING TO SCREW EACH OTHER OVER…? OR MAYBE, WE WORK TOGETHER. THIS TOWN'S GONNA FALL. MAYBE WE CAN PICK IT CLEAN, THEN WATCH EACH OTHER'S BACKS AS WE BAIL. I BELIEVE I ALREADY SAID NO. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS? YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME. AND THAT IS A PROBLEM… HOW? BUT DEEP DOWN, YOU SEE IT. I'M RAW, I'M UNTRAINED. AND I STILL MATCHED YOU MOVE FOR MOVE. YOU'RE SCARED OF ME. SCARED? OF YOU? YOU'RE A CHILD. I WAS STEALING THE ARISHOK'S GENITAL PIERCINGS BEFORE YOU STOPPED WETTING YOUR NAPPIES, YOU CRETIN. WELL, IF YOU'RE SO SURE YOU'RE BETTER, YOU WANNA BET ON THAT? GO ON. WE PICK A TARGET. FIRST ONE TO CON THEM OUTOF SOMETHING-- ANYTHING-- WINS. LOSER LEAVES TOWN? DEAL. HOW ABOUT HER? THE WOMAN I SAW YOU TALKING WITH BEFORE YOU TRIED TO CON ME? NICE TRY. IT WAS JUST A QUICK TALK WITH HER-- --A QUICK FLIRT, YOU MEAN. WHAT'S THE MATTER? CAN'T SPOT THE "" AMATEUR "" A HEAD START? FINE. FIRST TO GET SOMETHING FROM THE GIRL OR THE BROTHER. SURE. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, SHE'S HERE TO SEE ME. THE KEY HERE IS TO LET THE BOY DO MY WORK FOR ME. ALL I NEED IS THE NAMES OF THOSE TWO. OUR PARENTS HAD A LOT IN COMMON WITH YOUR FATHER. SHARED INTERESTS, IF YOU WILL. FRANCESCA, SHUSH. FLORIAN AND FRANCESCA INVIDUS? I AM MAGISTER ARAMIS, AND RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE INTERFERING IN MY INVESTIGATION. WE'RE SO SORRY… WE DIDN'T MEAN… IF YOU STAY AWAY FROM HOUSE QINTARA UNTIL THIS IS OVER, PERHAPS YOUR HOUSE CAN BE SPARED. FATHER WILL BE FURIOUS WITH YOU FOR THIS… BUT FLORIAN… I… LET ME DEAL WITH THIS MAGISTER. MY SISTER IS NAIVE. SHE TRUSTS TOO EASILY. THE VENATORI NEARLY DESTROYED TEVINTER. THE WORLD, EVEN. WE MUST FIND ALL FAMILIES WHO WERE PART OF THE GROUP --OR EVEN ASSISTED THEM. I ASSURE YOU, NEITHER FRANCESCA NOR I-- YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, ONCE A NAME IS IN A REPORT, I HAVE TO DO MY DUE DILIGENCE. CALIX…? MY BROTHER IS SPEAKING WITH THAT MAGISTER, SO WE ONLY HAVE A SHORT TIME. WE WEREN'T SURE IF YOUR FATHER IWAS WITH THE CAUSE, BUT NOW WE KNOW. I'D LIKE OUR HOUSES TO FORM AN ALLIANCE… AGAINST PERSECUTION FROM THE LUCERNI. OR ANYONE ELSE. IS THERE NOTHING I CAN DO TO MAKE THIS GO AWAY? MY SISTER AND I WOULD NOT WANT TO BLUNDER INTO ANYTHING THAT HURTS OUR FAMILY. OF COURSE. WE SHOULD TALK SOMEPLACE PRIVATE. THIS STONE CAN SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR SPECIAL MAGICKS… FRANCESCA! THANK YOU FOR THIS GIFT. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. I NEED TO WRAP THINGS UP WITH THE MAGISTER. A LOVELY GEMSTONE. USEFUL FOR MAGIC, NO? PERHAPS A DEMONSTRATION, YOUNG MASTER QINTARA? SHE IS NOT A MAGISTER! SHE'S A CON ARTIST! AND THIS YOUNG MAN IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT A QINTARA. HE IS A GRIFTER. WAIT… YOU'RE NOT…? ONE WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE RULES OF THE GAME, APPARENTLY. JULIUS! GRAB THE OTHERS! A PAIR OF CON ARTISTS HAVE JUST TRIED TO SWINDLE MY SISTER! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU DOLTS? MAGIC KILLS MABARI SAME AS MEN. THE MABARI'S GOT THE RIGHT IDEA.

I'M LOOKING FOR A WOMAN. HER NAME'S ELENA. WE WERE HERE AT YOUR MARKET JUST A WEEK AGO. HAVE YOU SEEN HER THIS MORNING? NO, MILORD. MANY APOLOGIES. YOU LOOKIN' FOR A TALL, ELEGANT GAL? SHORT HAIR? TRAVELS WIT' A MABARI PUPPY? YES. THAT'S HER. YOU'VE SEEN HER? ANYTHING OF VALUE MISSIN' THIS MORNIN'? YES, BUT THAT'S NOT-- YOU WON'T FIND HER. YOU'VE BEEN CONNED. AND ROBBED. HER NAME'S NOT ELENA, EITHER. IT'S…  HER NAME'S NOT ELENA, EITHER. IT'S… … OLIVIA PRYDE. FAILED ACTRESS. CONFIDENCE ARTIST. AS I AM A MAGISTER, PERHAPS IT'S BEST IF YOU LEAVE THIS MATTER TO ME, EH? BUT THESE TWO, THEY-- THEY WILL BE DEALT WITH, BUT NOT BY YOU, DEAR BOY. I SEE YOU'RE UP TO THE SAME OLD TRICKS. MY FRIEND CAN MAKE THAT PROBLEM GO AWAY. IF YOU PUT YOUR SKILLS TO USE FOR ME. MY ASSOCIATE NEEDS TO RETRIEVE SOMETHING FROM THE QINTARA ESTATE. SHE CAN BREAK INTO ANY-PLACE. SER AARON FLATTERS ME. IF SHE HAS ENOUGH INFORMATION TO WORK. THE BOY CLAIMS TO BE A QINTARA. IF HE'S WITH YOU, THEN HE CLEARLY IS A LIAR. HOWEVER, BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU, IT SEEMS SAFE TO ASSUME YOU CAN SECURE THE FLOOR PLANS TO THE ESTATE. FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T HELP? MY FRIEND THE MAGISTER TURNS YOU OVER TO THOSE MEN WHO WERE CHASING YOU. THIS WILL TAKE US BACK TO THE INN. YOU TWO CAN PLAN YOUR NEXT STEPS THERE. DRINKS ON YOU? IF THAT GETS YOU TO AGREE, SURE. I'M IMPRESSED. FINDING THE BACK WAY OUT OF THE INN WHERE YOU'RE STAYING HARDLY SEEMED YOUR STYLE ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. THAT'S MY SQUIRE'S INFLUENCE. SO YOUR NAME IS OLIVIA, HUH? WE'RE NOT HERE TO CHAT, MY BOY. WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A TASK, AND THE COVER YOU'VE CHOSEN FOR YOURSELF IS OUR BEST CHANCE OF GETTING IT DONE QUICKLY. GONNA BE TOUGH TO GET INFO ON THE QINTARA ESTATE. NOBODY'S BEEN IN THERE FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS. WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THE PLACE? NOT MUCH. WAS DECLARED A LANDMARK A WAYS BACK. THE QINTARA FAMILY HAS BEEN IMPORTANT SINCE THE START OF THE IMPERIUM. A LANDMARK? THAT MEANS THE ESTATE'S FLOOR PLANS HAVE TO BE KEPT IN OFFICIAL CITY RECORDS… YEAH, AT THE CITY'S VAULT. THAT'D BE HARDER TO BREAK INTO THAN THE ESTATE. BREAK INTO? YES. TALK OUR WAY INTO? MUCH EASIER. AFTER ALL. YOU'RE A QINTARA. I DUNNO. I'M GOOD AT TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY. LIKE THAT GORGEOUS LITTLE MAGE. PEOPLE AT THE VAULT WILL SEE RIGHT THROUGH ME. OH? I THOUGHT YOU ASPIRED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL. INSTEAD, YOU'RE SATISFIED JUST BEING A COMMON GRIFTER. COMMON GRIFTER PUTS FOOD IN MY BELLY. BUT YOU COULD BE SO MUCH MORE. A JOB LIKE THIS, DESPITE THE RUSHED CIRCUMSTANCES, CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU DO… AND WHAT I DO. ALE. ALE? FOR ME? SER AARON, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE. YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED A DROP SINCE STARKHAVEN. WHAT'S THE STORY WITH THIS OLIVIA? VAEA… THE LIFE I'VE LED… IT'S NOT A SOLITARY ONE, TO BE SURE. I'VE MADE FRIENDS, ADVENTURED WITH OTHERS. AND NOW I HAVE YOU. A PARTNER. AND SOMEONE TO TEACH. BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN TIME FOR ROMANCE. IN ALL MY YEARS, I'VE ONLY FALLEN IN LOVE ONCE. BUT I WAS A DRUNK. AND A FOOL. WELL, AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT A DRUNK ANY MORE. FAIR ENOUGH. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE! FLORIAN, LEAVE IT BE. THE ORB IS GONE. THE MAGISTER WILL DEAL WITH THIS, AND IF WE GET IT BACK, WONDERFUL. IF NOT-- IF NOT, FATHER WILL BE FURIOUS. YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN WITH THAT CHARLATAN. BROTHER, I AM SO SORRY. I REALLY THOUGHT WE COULD TRUST HIM. FRANCESCA, YOU ARE ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MAGES I KNOW. BUT YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN A STRATEGIST. THIS IS WHY FATHER AND I LEFT YOU OUT OF THE VENATORI. THAT "" CALIX QINTARA "" IS A HANDSOME MAN, WITH A LEAN BUILD, AND WE BOTH KNOW THAT IS YOUR WEAKNESS. HIS LOOKS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. I THOUGHT FATHER WOULD APPRECIATE A CONNECTION WITH HOUSE QINTARA. I THOUGHT YOU BOTH WOULD. I WAS WRONG TO BLAME YOU, FRANCESCA. FORGIVE ME. THE MAN WAS A PROFESSIONAL LIAR, AND ANYONE COULD HAVE BEEN FOOLED. THAT OTHER ONE HAD ME FOOLED AS WELL. THEY ARE BOTH DANGEROUS. AND EVIL. THAT IS WHY THEY CANNOT BE LEFT UNATTENDED. WHAT IF THEY FOOL MAGISTER PAVUS AS WELL? FLORIAN, DON'T-- NEVER FEAR, I'LL RETRIEVE THE FOCUSING GEM SO FATHER WILL NEVER FIND OUT. AND BOTH OF THOSE ROGUES WILL PAY. WITH THEIR LIVES. GOOD NEWS. I FOUND A DISTRACTION. IT'LL MAKE ME GOING INTO THE VAULT EASIER. THOSE TWO I SAW YOU GO UPSTAIRS WITH? STAY AWAY FROM THEM. THEY SEEM LIKE TROUBLE. MAYBE. BUT THEY'LL CREATE A DISTRACTION. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A LEDGER FROM THE VAULTS WHILE I'M IN THERE. A DISTRACTION? DID THEY SAY WHAT KIND? THIS IS A MISTAKE. BUT… THIS IS A TOUGH JOB, AND I GOT US HELP. IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE USEFUL. BUT IT MAY ALSO GET SOMEONE KILLED. WAIT HERE. MAY I HELP YOU? NICE ACCENT. ANTIVAN, NO? SO, MY GUESS IS YOU TWO ARE CROWS. WE ARE TRADERS, IN TOWN FOR A QUICK TRANSACTION. INVOLVING A… LEDGER, WAS IT? THE YOUNG MAN SPOKE WITH YOU. IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH OUR OFFER? NO. NO PROBLEM AT ALL. BUT THIS DISTRACTION YOU CREATE? IT CAN'T BE A VIOLENT ONE. IF WE GET THE JOB DONE, AND ENABLE YOU TO DO THE SAME, WHY DO YOU CARE? BECAUSE I PREFER NOT TO KILL. I LOATHE THAT KIND OF WORK. UGLY AND PETTY. SO. IF YOU WISH US TO RETRIEVE THIS LEDGER, YOU CANNOT KILL OR HURT ANYONE TO CREATE THE DISTRACTION. WE DON'T WANT TROUBLE, ANY MORE THAN YOU DO. DEAL. WONDERFUL. SEE? I THINK WE'LL GET ALONG SMASHINGLY. THIS IS WHAT WE GET FOR WORKING WITH AMATEURS. I LIKE HER. I KNEW IT. KNEW WHAT? YOU DO HAVE MORALS. YOU HEARD THAT? THE IMPORTANT PARTS. YOU TOOK A STAND. DID WHAT WAS RIGHT. HARDLY THE ACTIONS OF A MERE LIAR. I JUST DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO DIE. A MORAL STANCE. WHY SO CONCERNED ABOUT MY MORALITY? BRAVE SER KNIGHT… ARE YOU TRYING TO REDEEM ME? I "" FACILITATE "" CRIMES AGAINST WEALTHY NOBLES AND ACT AS A GO-BETWEEN FOR THE SALE OF THE "" PROCEEDS. "" LADY OLIVIA USUALLY PILFERS ITEMS OF VALUE FROM UNSUSPECTING NOBLES. SHE SELLS THEM TO ME. I SELL' EM ELSEWHERE, AND MY PROFITS GO TO FEED THE POOR. MY FIFTEEN COUSINS. DIRT POOR, THEY ARE. I BOUGHT THIS OFF HER. ONLY AFTER I'D PAID DID I GIVE IT A GOOD LOOK. I REALIZED THAT SHE'D STOLEN FROM SER AARON HAWTHORNE. LANDLESS KNIGHT. NO WEALTH TO SPEAK OF ONE OF US. THE TYPE OF MARK I WOULD NEVER TARGET. SO I'M GIVING THIS BACK TO YOU. SER AARON? EVERYTHING OKAY? THEY SAY YOU LEFT THE PALACE IN A HURRY? KING ALISTAIR, MY APOLOGIES. LADY ELENA LEFT, AND I WAS WORRIED. WILL THIS AFFECT YOUR TRIP TO EDGEHALL? WE CAN DELAY IT. NO, YOUR HIGHNESS. I WILL LEAVE TOMORROW. ANY TROUBLE HERE? JUST A MERCHANT, MY KING. I WILL JOIN YOU FOR LUNCH ONCE MY BUSINESS IS DONE. WHAT YOU JUST DID? ONE OF MANY REASONS I'M HAPPY TO EAT THIS LOSS, SER AARON. HOWEVER, IF YOU SEE LADY OLIVIA PRYDE AGAIN… TELL HER SHE'S DEAD TO ME. YOU WORKED WITH SLIM COULDRY FOR YEARS, DIDN'T YOU? KNEW HIS FEELINGS ON NOBILITY. YOU HAD TO KNOW HE WOULD REALIZE THE PENDANT WAS MINE. YOU HAD TO KNOW HE'D GIVE IT BACK, MAKE NO MONEY ON THE DEAL. AND THAT YOU WOULD END UP STEALING HIS MONEY, BUT NOTHING FROM ME. NOTHING PHYSICAL AT LEAST. YES. I KNEW IT. AND I WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT BACK. LET'S NOT MAKE A FUSS OVER IT, THOUGH. I KNEW IT.   I KNEW YOU WERE MORE THAN  A COMMON THIEF, ELENA.     MY NAME IS OLIVIA. AND DON'T KNOCK ME BEING A THIEF YOU TRAVEL WITH ONE NOW, DON'T YOU? BESIDES… I AM ANYTHING BUT COMMON.   STILL NOTHING? YOU AND I BOTH KNOW, THE PATROL IS NOT COMING BACK. THIS CITY IS DOOMED. WE CAN USE THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TO SAY? WE'VE BEEN OVER IT TEN TIMES. TEN IS HARDLY ENOUGH FOR A JOB LIKE THIS. JUST LOOK AT THAT VAULT. WELCOME TO VAULT. HOW MAY I ASSIST YOU? I AM MAGISTER ARAMIS, AND THIS YOUNG MAN IS CALIX QINTARA. THIS MAN KNOWS WHO I AM. WE SHARED DRINKS LAST NIGHT. AND QUITE A NIGHT IT WAS, EH? THAT IT WAS, GOOD SER. GOOD, THEN YOU CAN LET HIM PASS. I HAVE REQUESTED HE ESCORT ME TO THE QINTARA HOLDINGS IN THE VAULT. OF COURSE, MAGISTER. WE'LL JUST NEED TO SEE THE KEY ISSUED TO HIS FAMILY. THE PATROL HAS NOT RETURNED. AND THE SOLDIERS HAVE ABANDONED THIS CITY. THEY SAY THE CITY IS SURROUNDED. THE QUNARI WILL STRIKE WITHIN A DAY. I SAW MINISTERS FROM THE VAULT FLEEING THIS MORNING. MY FRIEND SAID ONE OF THEM STOLE HIS COIN AND USED IT TO PAY FOR A SHIP BOUND FOR MINRATHOUS! MY BOX! I WANT TO CHECK IT NOW! I'D LIKE TO TAKE ALL MY GOODS! IF YOU'LL ALL JUST CALM DOWN. YOU'D BEST GET INSIDE, YOUNG MASTER QINTARA. MAY I HELP YOU? I AM CALIX QINTARA. I SHOWED THE GUARD MY KEY, AND THIS… CHAOS DESCENDED. HE WENT TO QUELL IT. TOOK MY KEY, TOO. OH. UH… IF YOU'LL JUST WAIT HERE… YOUNG WOMAN, I AM A MAGISTER. AND THIS YOUNG MAN NEEDS TO SHOW ME HIS FAMILY'S ARCHIVES. THAT NONSENSE OUT FRONT WILL TAKE ALL DAY TO SORT OUT. SHALL I REPORT TO THE MAGISTERIUM THAT YOU DELAYED MY INVESTIGATION? QUICKLY, GRAB THE FLOOR PLANS. I'LL GET THIS LEDGER YOUR NEW FRIENDS ARE SO INTERESTED IN. DELIVERED ON TIME, VIA MABARI. I LIKE THIS WOMAN'S STYLE. GOOD GIRL. YOU CAN GO. WE HAVE TROUBLE. THAT MONGREL BELONGS TO ONE OF A PAIR OF SCAM ARTISTS. WHICH MEANS YOU KNAVES ARE IN LEAGUE WITH THEM. WE PROMISED HER WE WOULD NOT SPILL BLOOD. AS PART OF THE DISTRACTION. THE DEAL IS DONE, AND IT IS US THIS FOOL THREATENS. TELL ME WHERE TO FIND THEM, OR I TELL THIS WHOLE CITY YOU ARE CRIMINALS! NOT CRIMINALS. CROWS. AS I SAID. ANYTHING BUT COMMON. INDEED. YOU HAVE MY THANKS. THE WORK YOU DID HERE WILL SAVE LIVES. YOU'LL PRETEND THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU. BUT I THINK IT DOES. THE RUMORS ABOUT THIS CITY ARE TRUE. IT IS SURROUNDED, AND WILL FALL. LEAVING WILL BE DIFFICULT. BUT IF YOU WAIT FOR ME, I PROMISE YOU, LADY OLIVIA PRYDE. YOU WILL LEAVE THIS TOWN SAFELY. RIGHT, WELL, I GUESS WE'RE DRINKING NOW. THE WAY YOU SWOOPED IN THERE? TALKING ALL MAGISTER-EY? AMAZING. YOU DID QUITE WELL, YOURSELF. FOR A MORON, YOU MEAN. YES. FOR A MORON. SO, OLIVIA PRYDE…? THAT'S YOUR REAL NAME? YES, AND DAMN SER AARON FOR SHARING IT WITH YOU. LET ME GUESS… YOURS IS ACTUALLY… CALIX. I KNOW. SLOPPY. AND AMATEURISH. BUT I DIDN'T ADOPT THE QINTARA NAME TO SCAM PEOPLE. I DID IT BECAUSE MY MASTER DIED WHEN THE VENATORI WERE DEFEATED, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE AUCTIONED OFF. YOUR… MASTER? I WAS THE ONE HE TAUGHT TO READ AND WRITE. THOSE SKILLS GAVE ME A LEG UP. SO I JUST RAN TO VENTUS, SLAPPED THE QINTARA NAME AT THE END OF MINE, AND STARTED LIVING OFF IT. YOU DID ALL THIS AS A RUNAWAY SLAVE. JUST TO SURVIVE? YOU IMPRESS ME, CALIX. I'LL HAVE THAT ALE NOW. EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING FOR MY BROTHER. MY BROTHER FLORIAN AND I SHOP AT YOUR STALL EVERY WEEK. HE DIDN'T COME HOME LAST NIGHT. HAVE YOU SEEN HIM? NO, MILADY. MANY APOLOGIES.

THEIR PARENTS DIED, NOT AT THE SAME TIME, BUT… … IT'S NOT IMPORTANT. ANDREA… SHE WAS WITH THIS GUY, DALE, AT THE TIME. THEY TOOK THEM IN… THEY SORT OF BECAME THEIR PARENTS. THEY ADOPTED THEM. THEY WERE YOUNGER THAN I WAS… EVERYTHING THAT WAS HAPPENING, IT AFFECTED THEM MORE. IT CONFUSED THEM. BEN, HE… ONE DAY HE KILLED BILLY. HE STABBED HIM WITH A KNIFE. HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. HE THOUGHT BILLY WOULD COME BACK AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE OKAY… IT WAS HORRIBLE. THE POOR KID DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE WHAT HE'D DONE. THIS, WELL, IT UPSET EVERYONE, AND IT LED TO A PRETTY HEATED DEBATE. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A CHILD WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT KILLING IS? BACK THEN WE WERE SLEEPING IN CARS, TENTS, WHATEVER WE COULD FIND. WHEN WE STAYED IN A HOUSE, WE ALL STAYED TOGETHER. HE WASN'T SAFE TO KEEP AROUND. SOMEONE, I DON'T REMEMBER WHO, BROUGHT UP THE IDEA OF KILLING HIM. IT SEEMED LIKE THE ONLY OPTION AT THE TIME. HE COULD KILL ANY ONE OF US IN OUR SLEEP. ANDREA WOULDN'T HEAR IT. SHE WAS FURIOUS--SHE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS EVEN BEING SUGGESTED. THEY LOCKED HIM IN A VAN FOR THE NIGHT. THEY WERE GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH HIM IN THE MORNING. I OVERHEARD THEM TALKING. THEY'D SAY THINGS LIKE, "" HOW COULD WE KILL A KID? "" THEY KNEW IT NEEDED TO BE DONE, BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY COULD DO IT. SO I SNUCK IN THE VAN WHILE EVERYONE WAS SLEEPING… AND I KILLED HIM. I FIGURED IT WAS OKAY FOR ANOTHER KID TO KILL A KID… OR AT THE VERY LEAST IT WAS EASIER. I WANTED TO TAKE THAT BURDEN ON, LIKE IT WAS A WAY I COULD HELP. I NEVER TOLD ANYONE. THEY WOKE UP THE NEXT DAY AND HE WAS JUST DEAD. PEOPLE SUSPECTED OTHERS… BUT NO ONE EVER KNEW. I EVENTUALLY TOLD MY DAD… BUT NOT ANDREA. NOT UNTIL YEARS LATER… AFTER THE BIG FIGHT WITH NEGAN AND THE SAVIORS… WE'D GROWN SO CLOSE AND I FELT BAD KEEPING IT FROM HER. SO I TOLD HER… … AND SHE CRIED. SHE CRIED A LOT. THEN SHE WIPED THE TEARS FROM HER EYES AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SHE SAID, "" I LOVE YOU. "" MY DAD ONCE TOLD ME THAT YOUR PARENTS LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT. THEY CAN BE ASHAMED OF YOU OR DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, AND THEY CAN EVEN NOT LIKE WHO YOU ARE IN THE MOMENT… BUT THEY ALWAYS LOVE YOU… … NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. SO THAT'S WHEN I STARTED CALLING ANDREA "" MOM. "" NO, PLEASE. DON'T MIND ME, JUST KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. RICK? I'M REALLY SORRY TO DO THIS NOW, BUT IT JUST CAN'T WAIT. I KNOW. I KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. LET'S GO INSIDE. HOW COULD YOU DO IT? HOW COULD YOU LET HIM OUT? HE'S OUT THERE RIGHT NOW, FREE. GODDAMN IT, RICK --WHY?! I COULDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT. THAT'S GOING AROUND… I'M SORRY, I KNOW YOU'RE-- NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH… NOW MORE THAN EVER, FRANKLY. IF HE'D KILLED ANDREA… I DON'T KNOW… SO WHY IS HE FREE? I LOOK AT NEGAN NOW, AND HONESTLY… I THINK OF HOW MANY HUSBANDS I'VE KILLED… … HOW MANY WIVES. I'M NOT EXCUSING WHAT HE DID. I STILL THINK ABOUT GLENN EVERY SINGLE DAY. IT STILL HURTS. BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT BE HAUNTED BY THE FACT THAT I DON'T REALLY SEE WHAT MAKES ME SO DIFFERENT. YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS… YOU CAN'T COMPARE-- I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO AGREE WITH ME… BUT I CAN'T KILL THAT MAN, AND IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO LOCK HIM UP FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. IF IT HELPS --HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO STAY HERE. THE DEAL WAS HE LEAVES AS SOON AS THE CONFLICT IS OVER. HE SHOULD BE ON HIS WAY SOON. THAT'S REALLY… … KIND OF YOU. HEH. I MISSED YOU, TOO. I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED, YOU'D GONE DARK FOR A LONG TIME… THEN WHEN SOMEONE ELSE GOT ON THE RADIO, I FEARED FOR THE WORST. OVER. SOMEONE ELSE? YOU TALKED TO SOMEONE ELSE HERE? OVER. @ IT WAS A MAN. I WROTE HIS NAME DOWN, HOLD ON… SIDDIQ. HE SAID HIS NAME WAS SIDDIQ. HE TOLD ME YOU WEREN'T THERE, ASKED WHO I WAS. HE SOUNDED FRANTIC. @ I DIDN'T ANSWER. I TOLD YOU I WOULD ONLY SPEAK TO YOU. OVER. THINGS GOT CRAZY HERE. THE DEAD BREACHED OUR WALLS. SIDDIQ IS A GOOD MAN, HE MUST HAVE HIDDEN HERE FOR SAFETY. I'M SORRY IF HE STARTLED YOU-- SOMEONE IS AT MY DOOR. THINGS HAVE BEEN INTENSE HERE… I'LL… WE'LL TALK LATER. I'M SORRY. OVER. UM… TELL ME ABOUT THE RADIO. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KEPT THIS FROM ME. I NEED TO TALK TO HER. SHE ONLY TALKS TO-- I NEED TO TALK TO HER, EUGENE. STEPHANIE, ARE YOU THERE? OVER. @ I AM. WHO WAS AT YOUR DOOR? IS EVERYTHING OKAY? @ OVER. IT WAS OUR LEADER, RICK GRIMES. I HADN'T TOLD HIM ABOUT YOU, LIKE I PROMISED, BUT SIDDIQ TOLD HIM. I'M SORRY, BUT HE WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU… OVER. @ NO. I TOLD YOU. I WOULD ONLY TALK TO YOU. I ONLY TRUST YOU. @ I CAN'T TAKE ANY RISKS. @ OVER. STEPHANIE, I AM BEGGING YOU. TRUST RICK LIKE YOU TRUST ME. WE ARE HURTING HERE. IT'S IMPORTANT YOU TALK TO RICK. PLEASE. I PROMISE YOU WILL LIKE HIM MORE THAN YOU LIKE ME. OVER. STEPHANIE, IS IT? LISTEN, THIS IS RICK GRIMES. I'M THE LEADER OF THIS COMMUNITY, AND WE'RE PART OF A NETWORK OF COMMUNITIES THAT KEEPS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE SAFE. WE'VE RECENTLY SEEN OUR HOMES DECIMATED, WE'VE GOT A LOT TO REBUILD, AND IF YOU'RE AS BIG A COMMUNITY AS I THINK YOU ARE --I THINK YOU CAN HELP. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED… HELP. YOU HAVE TO SAY-- OVER. @ I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN HELP. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US SEEMS TOO GREAT. @ OVER. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITIES HERE SEEMED GREAT AT FIRST. THEN OVER TIME WE SECURED SAFE TRAVEL ROUTES BETWEEN THEM --MADE IT VIABLE TO TRAVEL FROM PLACE TO PLACE AGAIN. WE COULD DO THAT WITH YOU. LISTEN. THIS IS ABOUT TRUST. I GET IT. YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO EUGENE FOR WEEKS, AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TRYING TO PRY INFORMATION OUT OF HIM. I'M CONFIDENT YOU'RE NOT PLANNING TO ATTACK US. I'M WILLING TO BET YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL IN REACHING OUT THE WAY YOU HAVE IS THE EXACT KIND OF COOPERATION I'M PROPOSING. OVER. @ GO ON. @ OVER. YOU NAME THE PLACE. CLOSE TO YOU, SO WE DO ALL THE TRAVELING, AND YOU CAN PREPARE FOR OUR ARRIVAL, BUT NOT SO CLOSE WE COULD FIND YOU. WE'LL SEND A SMALL TEAM TO THE AREA YOU CHOOSE. WE'LL BE COMPLETELY VULNERABLE. YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU SEE WHEN WE ARRIVE… YOU DON'T MAKE CONTACT. IT'S ALL IN YOUR HANDS. OVER. @ I THINK I COULD SELL SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO MY PEOPLE. GIVE ME A DAY. @ OVER. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? I TRUST HER… BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I TRUST HER THAT MUCH. WE HAVE TO TAKE RISKS… THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO HIDE OUT. WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET. KEEP TALKING TO HER. TELL ME IF SHE SAYS ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS. I'LL GATHER A TEAM. I HAVE TO BE ON THAT TEAM. SHE TRUSTS ME. OKAY. UNDERSTOOD. DWIGHT. HAVE YOU SEEN JESUS? NO. BEEN WORKING TOO HARD… WOULDN'T NOTICE HIM IF I DID SEE HIM. I'M SORRY. I AM. YOU JUST KEEP ON BUZZING, BUSY BEE. MAKE EVERYONE THINK YOU'RE HOLDING THIS PLACE TOGETHER… WHEN REALLY YOU'RE JUST MAKING SURE YOU GET CREDIT. I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING RIGHT NOW, BUT WHEN I'M DONE, YOU AND ME ARE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND TALK. OKAY? I'D LIKE THAT. PACKING UP ALREADY? PEOPLE ARE DONATING THINGS… GOTTA KEEP IT SOMEWHERE, MIGHT AS WELL GO AHEAD AND PACK IT UP. WE'LL BE HITTING THE ROAD IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO. IF WE DON'T START REBUILDING SOON, WE NEVER WILL. I CAN'T HAVE MY PEOPLE GETTING TOO COMFORTABLE HERE. IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ME, DON'T. THE HILLTOP IS MY HOME. I'LL HELP REBUILD IT. CARL, NO ONE EXPECTS YOU TO COME BACK WITH US. NOT AFTER-- WHY? WHAT DOES THAT CHANGE? WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER? YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE HIM? I HAVEN'T TOLD HIM YET. HE'LL UNDERSTAND. HE DOESN'T NEED ME HERE. WHAT DO YOU NEED? I NEED TO LIVE MY OWN LIFE… SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN HERE. WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? NOTHING YOU'RE NOT USED TO. MEET THESE PEOPLE, GET A READ ON THEM, MAKE SURE WE CAN TRUST THEM. THERE'S SOME DANGER TO IT, BUT THESE PEOPLE SEEM TRUSTWORTHY ALREADY. I'D GO MYSELF IF I COULD. OHIO? TRIP LIKE THAT COULD TAKE WEEKS. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY NO. I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS KIND OF THING ANYMORE. I HAVE SOMETHING WORTH STAYING FOR. IF YOU CAN'T FIND ANYONE ELSE, IF YOU'RE DESPERATE, I WON'T LET YOU DOWN. BUT I'M TELLING YOU I'D PREFER YOU FOUND SOMEONE ELSE. I'M SURE AARON CAN HANDLE IT ON HIS OWN, HE'S NO STRANGER TO BEING OUT BEYOND THE WALL. UM… ACTUALLY… WHEN I SAID I HAVE SOMETHING WORTH STAYING FOR --IT WAS A SOMEONE. A SPECIFIC SOMEONE, ACTUALLY… … IT'S AARON. I WAS TALKING ABOUT AARON. HE'S NOT GOING TO WANT TO GO EITHER. OH, OKAY THEN. CONGRATULATIONS. I'M HAPPY FOR YOU. DWIGHT, WE NEED TO SETTLE THIS SHIT BETWEEN US BECAUSE I NEED YOUR HELP. I NEED YOU TO GO ON A TRIP FOR ME. THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP OUT THERE WE NEED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH. TO PUT IT BLUNTLY… … NO. WHY, DWIGHT? I'M SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED, MORE THAN I CAN SAY, BUT I'M STILL TAKEN ABACK BY HOW YOU'RE ACTING LATELY. I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT. YOU KNOW ME. YOU KNOW I'D NEVER-- I FEEL LIKE WE'D BE BETTER OFF WITH ME HERE. I THINK I SHOULD STAY --AND RUN THINGS. I THINK YOUR TIME IS DONE, RICK. WHAT? YOU DIDN'T WANT TO LEAD THE SAVIORS, BUT NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE OVER HERE? EXPLAIN THE CHANGE OF HEART TO ME. I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAD THE SAVIORS BECAUSE I SAW WHAT WAS BOILING THERE. THE RAGE AND HATRED. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A PART OF IT. NOW I SEE THE CAUSE OF THAT HATRED. IT'S YOU, RICK. YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES… FOR US ALL… AND YET, HERE YOU ARE --JUST ACTING IMPULSIVELY. CONFIDENT THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS RIGHT. BECAUSE YOU'RE SURE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO… NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE DOING IT. EVEN IF THAT THING IS KILLING THE WOMAN I LOVED. ... SHERRY ATTACKED ME. I DEFENDED MYSELF. I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK HAPPENED… BUT HOW COULD I KNOW? ALL I HAVE TO GO ON IS YOUR WORD. ... I KNOW YOU'D LIKE TO TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE THINGS UNDER CONTROL. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE REALLY A MAN LOOKING TO KILL A WOMAN IN COLD BLOOD. I BELIEVE A VERSION OF WHAT YOU SAY HAPPENED. THE FACT REMAINS, I SAW YOU ESCALATE A CONFRONTATION WITH THE SAVIORS AT A TIME WHEN WE ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT AFFORD ONE. AND I SAW YOU ALLOW THAT CONFRONTATION TO BE DEFUSED BY NEGAN, A MAN WE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT AFFORD TO TRUST. I'M NOT SITTING HERE WITH MY SOLDIERS, WHO I BELIEVE WOULD BE STANDING BEHIND ME WERE I TO ASK, I'M HAVING THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. I COULD JUST AS EASILY BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH A SHOTGUN TO THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD. I'M NOT. I WANT YOU TO RECOGNIZE HOW REASONABLE I'M BEING HERE. I'M WHAT THESE PEOPLE NEED. YOU'VE HAD YOUR TIME AND YOU'VE LOST A STEP. THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER. WHAT? I'VE GOT A COMMUNITY IN ASHES AND ANOTHER REELING FROM AN ATTACK. I JUST LOST MY WIFE, AND I'VE JUST MOMENTS AGO DISCOVERED A NEW, LARGER NETWORK OF COMMUNITIES. I DON'T HAVE FUCKING TIME FOR THIS RIGHT NOW. SO, AS I SAID, THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

Whatever's happening, one thing's for sure-- I'm done with these fuckers. Shit. GOD DAMMIT, ONE MORE TIME-- #HRF! WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?! YOU TELL ME, UNITY. FUCK YOU! IS --IS IT TRUE?

ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES- AND WE CAN HEAD OUT OF TOWN. HEAD OUT OF TOWN…? TO WHERE? THEY'LL HUNT US DOWN. AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO SURVIVE THAT OUT THERE. MAYBE WE CAN… THE CURSE EXTENDS OUT OF TOWN NOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR, BUT-- IT'S NOT FAR AT ALL… NOT AT ALL… WE CHANGED THE MAP. WAIT. WHAT? WE WERE IN GALEN'S OFFICE. YOU WERE ABOUT TO DIE. I SAW THE ORIGINAL TOWN MAP AND JUST THOUGHT… WHAT MAKES A TOWN? THE CURSE FOLLOWS ITS BORDERS, SO WHAT IF WE… CHANGED THE BORDERS. HOLY SHIT. HOLY SHIT. GALEN KNOWS. I'M NOT SURE WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO WITH THE INFORMATION, BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE GOOD WE NEED TO STOP HIM. I KNOW YOU WANT TO LEAVE. BUT YOU'VE LIVED HERE FOR DECADES, LAURA.     THESE PEOPLE MUST MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU. WE HAVE AN ADVANTAGE NOW. YOU SAW HOW UNITY TREATED YOU, HOW THE TOWNSPEOPLE REACTED TO THE NEWS OF YOUR ""MIRACLE"". DANIEL… YOU CAN BE THE TOWN'S SAVIOR. SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? THE WAY I SEE IT, WE HAVE A PROBLEM THAT GOES BEYOND THE SITUATION WITH DANIEL AND HIS MOTHER. NO KIDDING. THIS TOWN CAN'T STOP TEARING ITSELF APART. IT'S IN-FIGHTING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE CAUSE OF IN-FIGHTING IS? A LACK OF A COMMON ENEMY. A LACK OF A GOAL. THIS TOWN'S STAGNATION, ITS REPETITION, IS THE REAL CAUSE OF THE UPHEAVAL. SO LET'S CHANGE THAT.

SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING… WE JUST NEEDED TO HAMMER OUT SOME DETAILS FIRST. WHAT KIND OF DETAILS… AND DO ANY OF THEM INVOLVE KILLING THOSE TRAITORS? LAURA AND HER CREW… ARE NOT THE PROBLEM. TELL ME, KREEGS, HOW HAVE YOU ENJOYED YOUR TIME IN STILLWATER SO FAR? IT'S BEEN… PEACEFUL. ASIDE FROM SHIT LIKE THIS. ""PEACEFUL"". AND BORING, YEAH? SUPPOSE SO. WHY? DANIEL DIDN'T SURVIVE BECAUSE OF A MIRACLE. HE SURVIVED BECAUSE… HIS MOTHER CHANGED THE BORDERS ON STILLWATER'S ORIGINAL MAP. ARE YOU-- ARE YOU SERIOUS? IS THAT SO HARD TO BELIEVE?
